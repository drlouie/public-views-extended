I don't know how pointing out inconsistancies in the ad are bashing the product,  but maybe in your world.  I also am not aware that I have had any dealings with you on anything,  and if I did it was totally unknown to me, and I am very sorry.  I did get a few tubes from Woody, and yes they were pretty nice.  If that had anything to do with you,  I appologize to everyone publicly.   And I have never made any complaints about the selling prices of laser aimers,  just that the market controls the price, which it does.  You get them and sell them for whatever people are willing to pay,  free market forces at work.  I have no problem with that.

The only negative perosn on this forum is you. It is always a positive and educating place to learn about night vision until you show your angry face.  Do you think it is a coincidence that nobody except you has anything nice to say about you, except for the aliases you post under. Haven't you figured out by now that it is you, not everbody else.

If you're screwing the troops by stealing their gear (or buying it,same-same, G.I.) somebody should be cutting YOU off.......I VOLUNTEER.  See, I did'nt hear a denial here, I heard an ADMISSION. Ask any shrink/trained interrogator what THEY see above.....<br>
  <br>
<br>
                   So, here it is, BUCKO, I see any more **** about you threatening people or talking stupid, I'm gonna crawl so far up your ass you'll be tongue-tied. I'll bet I can get people to put you in a cell just to cover themselves, how about it? By the time I make a dozen phone calls to all the major networks,and a few newspapers, telling them all about this guy named American Surplus who's undermining the war on terror by selling stolen NV gear(think you have anything to worry about in all the stuff you've posted in the last 3 months? I'VE ARCHIVED EVERYTHING YOU'VE POSTED for sale on multiple boards.........)                    Now, you're probably telling yourself, &quot;Self, you're covered, no problem there&quot;, but your &quot;coverage&quot; will disappear the moment an assistant U.S Attorney starts asking the wrong questions. He/She subpoenas the right people to testify in front of a Grand Jury, and you and the ham sandwich are both toast.<br>
<br>
                          Here's the part you'll like. Not only did I use to work at the Federal Building complex in Chicago for the FPS,(Federal Protective Service, aka the GSA police), dealing with those aformentioned assistant U.S. Attorney's, a Judge or two, and numerous FBI DEA types (ATF moved over to Canal St. almost ten years ago) but my partner in the P.I. business wound up helping the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office on an interstate theft/fraud case where the scumbag responsible got a nice vacation at club fed. Yeah, I think I know who to call....... <br>
<br>
                         You should be getting the feeling that I have done this kind of thing to deserving individuals before.(the cop my partner and I arrested at gunpoint thought so after we had him fired and prosecuted) Oh, I'm talking smack, right?Call up the Wilmette Illinois PD and ask them what happened to Ofc. Dwayne Belcher..... You should also be getting the desire to crawl back off this board and stay there. (if I may say so, Chris) I'm pretty sure something bad will happen to you in a while anyway, it always does with guys like you, but if I can indulge my sadistic streak and benefit the community at the same time by speeding up the process, well, everybody wins, except you, which would make you the LOSER, loser.........<br>

			<P></center>if it did have the pin in the ele. knob then it probably was mine. There were no scratches or gouges. The only defects were the pin as stated and the battery cap had some of the parkerizing worn down which could be reparked to look good again.It was nice but not as nice as the HK93 with the MSG90 stock and FBI SF lower i got with the money .A Stanag ARMS mount for the Aquilla and a KAC RAS and it will be one more project done. ; )<br>

<br>
2) ...reticles mounted in the eye piece.<br>
<br>
The concensus of experienced users suggest the type 1 option provides the most accuracy becuase it eleimantes eye piece parallax.<br>
<br>
However, if you are a solid shooter with a traditional daylight scope, you should not have any problem with a rear eye piece mounted reticle.<br>
<br>
The last thing to consider in both types of reticles... not all systems are created equal. Another words, a Raptor reticle by design can handle more abuse than an ATN NV reticle. This comparison may also serve to demonstrate both end of the quality spectrum, although there are better systems than the Raptor as well as worse systems than ATN.<br>
<br>
That being said, I have an illuminated eye peice reticle for my ATN Patriot monocular, and it has been a very solid performer. But their other weapon sight systems have mixed reviews with a larger share of negative feedback from respectable NV sources.<br>
<br>
Good luck<br>

TIA<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 25, 2002, 2:25 PM<BR> from IP address 212.2.2.85</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035581154'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Yes to swap...</b><br>by RJ<P></center>... that is one of the great features of this unit, the tube can be easily upgraded.<br>
<br>
Cost?  That depends... a brand new tube OMNI IV will cost you in the $3000 range. If you have the $$$, this option will get you a tube with factory paper work outlining the specs. I recently bought a new OMNI IV tube for less than $3000, but it took 8 months for delivery. I could have had it faster if I was willing to pay more.<br>
<br>
You have other, less expensive options.<br>
<br>
Option 1) A new tube that has been repaired. I also recently bought a repotted OMNI IV quality NV tube and I very happy with the tube. I am so pleased with this tube, if I had the chance to buy the new OMNI IV mentioned above, I might well have gone for this option instead.<br>
<br>
Option 2) A uesd tube with info on the condition, age and current performance. Of these two alternatives, this one is the most risky, IMHO.<br>
<br>
If you would like to persue option #1, contact Lanny on this list. He sold me the repotted tube and I would buy from him again.<br>
<br>
Good luck, and you might consider holding onto your 6015B tube as a back up.<br>

P/N: MS28775-044: NSN: 5330-01-098-1232.<br>
If you are aquianted with the MS sys then you can easily find this,otherwise here is the description:<br>
O-ring: I.D.=3.739 +/- .027<br>
        Width= .070 +/-.003<br>
      Nominal size: 3 3/4 I.D. x 3 7/8 O.D.x 1/16 Thk. Rember o-ring sizes are given by the Inside Dia not the Outside Dia.<br>
All o-rings are not equal, this is/was a BUNA N (Nitrile) o-ring. It should be lubricated very lightly with SUPER O-LUBE grease. Not all grease is compatible with all o-ring material, if you dont have any super o-lube I recommend using nothing, since this is a static load anyway.<br>
When installing the o-ring make sure that you do not &quot;roll&quot; (twist) the ring as it goes into the groove.<br>
Where to get one ? Around here I go the local bearing supply house, many times they will just give you one. Motion Industries is a good source if there is one near you.<br>

			<P></center>and others are the best place to find reviews from actual users,  which often seem to vary anyway, depending on a lot of factors including the user.   If you are a dealer,  the best way is to buy the items you plan to sell,  and try them yourself.  That is the only way you can give an honest review to your customer.  Then you can say, &quot;I did this and this, and the device performed in this way with these results&quot;.  Otherwise you are merely passing along someone's unconfirmed opinion.  <P><center><i>Posted on Oct 24, 2002, 10:53 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.50</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035481997'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Use two tripods to match the devices up as the shutter speed is rather slow. It still won't be perfect but it may help.

I went through the previous transactions that he had, and nothing was of the night vision type. If you asked me, I would say that this is a hijacked Ebay account, or something of the sort.

			<P></center>  Is usually glued in place and can be a real SOB to remove.  I usually go ahead and break the ring off with a pair if channel locks and then I have found that by amazing cinsidence that the insert lock ring onthe PVS-5a objective lense is almost exactly the same size as the broken ring that was removed ,so i replace the broken ring with the insert lock ring from the PVS-5a objective lense.  If you dont have any of these just send the broken eyeguard ring pieces from the original eyepiece ring over to your machinest and have him make a new one for you .<br>
   No machinest?  hmmmmmmm   you outa luck.  Our machinest only charges about $25.00 to make new ones.<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 25, 2002, 12:36 AM<BR> from IP address 65.58.170.100</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035531402'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>old bean,  we are in a civilized and unleaky condition over here.  First thing I did with the Norton was split the cases and replace the varnish with some good case sealant(yamabond 4) to stop that annoying drip of oil.  Rover has yet to undergo an overhaul,  so of course that is a bit drippy after years of abuse by your RAF and RM.  However they did maintain it well, so it is still running great. <P><center><i>Posted on Oct 24, 2002, 8:31 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.192</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035516667'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I tried the both.<br>
recon-1 with gen1 tuben, 2x mag.<br>
the view angle is only 9°, that you seems to look throught a long tube.<br>
it's externaly like a PVS-502, the eyepieces are longer., it's builded like a PVS-7, same switch off-on-on/ir with one led for IR, one for battery level.<br>
photo-sensitive cutt-off. for a Gen-1, the image is not too bad, I think the front lens is a f.2, could be better with a f.1.5 or higher.<br>
PGN-2 ( OVN-1) is a goggles, gen 1 tubes( 2 tubes) like a 2 ELF combination.built in IR source( poor gain, bad led) cool image with stereoscopic effect.<br>
a little bit heavy, long use as goggles is a little bit tiring. I saw better Gen1 binoculars like RIGEL 3100( D-2M).<br>
I didn't try other LOMO products.<br>
I hope to try a RECON-2( copy of PVS-7), gen2+, soon <br>

			<P></center>as I wrote sooner, I've tested this one.<br>
it's really a excellent copy of the PVS-7/502.<br>
the difference is into the tube housing in Gen1 who is taller than a 18mm gen2+. <br>
there are two leds in the sight, one for the IR source when it is witched on( the IR led cannot be seen by the eye when on, like military NVg, opposite to the red 680/750nm led usually used on gen1 NVD.<br>
the other led is for the battery level and can be seen under 2.5V.<br>
the eyepieces are adjustable in width, dioptric is -4/+5. the front lens is a f.2, FOV only 9°, range 2meters to infinity.<br>
the image is clear, it's a Gen1 so don't expect the same than a Gen2., the resolution could be approx 25 lp/mm, 30 lp/mm max...I don't have what to test it exactly.<br>
you can see a man standing in a full moon night within 250/300 meters.<br>
the devise is equiped to fix a standard photographic tripod( not inclued) and is sold with a nylon bag with a tighten strap in it and pocket for the spare batteries.<br>
I've been told a RECON-1, 1x with headset is aviable but very hard to find, never seen it.<br>
that's all.<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 25, 2002, 1:44 AM<BR> from IP address 81.48.38.222</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035535498'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

I read somewhere only 2500 hours for a 2nd gen tube!  That doesn't seem very long, but that figure could be wrong.  Also, if one is bought on the surplus or used market, would it's life be significantly shorter?  Is there any way to tell how much a tube has been used?   <br>

The reason I'm asking these questions is because I'm considering the purchase of a 2nd generation surplus scope (PVS-5) and I don't want the tube burning out after only a few months or year.<br>

			<P></center>the answer is: it depends!!!!!<br>
<br>
I personnaly use a 15 years old gen2 tube on my goggles...it only shon some defect signs since the last year...sometimes it doesn't want to start.....<br>
<br>
all is in the used of the tube. each tube has tis own specifications, even if they are made in the same time in the same factory...some will be good enough for Milspec, some others not...this is why the &quot;Hand held&quot; selected googles are more expensive than the others.<br>
if the tube you want to buy was used by army men, you can ask yourself how wasit used? did they take care, did it take bright light source, ect....<br>
was it good stored, protected by the temperature variation, humidity.....<br>
the most to care about is if the tube was on the air or not .if you want to buy an anvis tube or a PVS-5 or 7 than can be used by airmen, air troops or parajumpers etc....how high did it go, how may &quot;G&quot; did it take?( if flown in a jet)...<br>
a friend of mine who is NVG specialist( I'm not) told me he saw PVS-5 Gen2 tube lived over 20 years and gen3 anvis tube died after a few months....<br>
here in french army, tubes are putted off of duty after 10 years or 2500 hours...that doesn't means the tube is dead, it's only for the reason when your life depends on the material yu use, you'd better think to check it and change it after a certain time of use.<br>
so, each time it's a gambling, even you'll buy a brand new tube....this is the Murphy's law...the chance you have than the tube will died is equal of the number of the componenets that are used to build it, plus one...the very bad luck!<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 23, 2002, 4:26 AM<BR> from IP address 80.14.118.70</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035372381'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>This answer is unsettling considering the high price!</b><br>by Monty<P></center>This answer is unsettling.  I gather from it that the surplus market should probably be avoided.  After all, who wants to pay $1000 for a used scope and have it burn out in 3 months!  I don't.  I wonder how many consumers are aware of this uncertainty factor and have been &quot;burned&quot;.  I would think that at the high used prices the longevity would be much more predictable and better, but perhaps not.  Unless someone else has something to add, I think I'm going to stick with my cheap but decent $70 gen 1 scope and one million cp infrared spotlight. I had just hoped to get away from using such a strong infrared source and move more toward the passive.  Oh well.<br>

			<P></center>...is not unsettling.....<br>
of course a new Gen3 or gen2 tube is beleived to live a longer time.....all depends on what you will do with it.and in a normal use, it'll be unsettling the tube burn after 3 months...but if it's new it'll be under warranty.ask Murphy's thoughts for that...<br>
used with care, you can have it for a long long time....in some conditions, you will be sure that your tubes will not go on for long.<br>
all tubes used in airplanes have a shorter life.<br>
this is easilly understood for who knows a little about jet and G-force. not only the pilot have to stand the G, all the plane and it's componenets too, and anvis too.<br>
so here, I'm not talking about image quality but how long will live the tube.So you can take you $70 tube if you want with 1000000 of IR lights...it won't change anything in the lifespan of a gen2 or gen3 tube( even a gen1).<br>
as I said, I'm not a specialist, I only used NVG for long, at home, for hobby or fun but in military operations too on the field.<br>
I can say I saw tubes used in careless conditions and going on working after all for several years.I've held in my hand a Gen2+ brand new goggles that worked only a few hours before the tube died( electrical  problem in build in circuit if I remember).<br>
the rule is the tube usually live for long time( over 2500 hours, you can hope a 10 000 hours life in most of case)but it might be a tube live only a few hours.<br>
that's all<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 23, 2002, 3:40 PM<BR> from IP address 80.14.118.70</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035412803'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Just bought a surplus tube and wonder how long it will last</b><br>by Jason<P></center>I didn't think about tube life until I saw this post.  Just picked up a supposedly good, surplus 9916 tube with 1 year warranty.  Now I'm wondering if I should reconsider my purchase.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I don't understand why these tubes wouldn't last very long unless they're used with greater than necessary operating voltages and currents.  Most vacuum tubes, for example, outlast the radios they were removed from, typically 30-40 years ago and keep going strong when used in other applications.  In fact, I have some old 1920's radio tubes that are still being used in a radio set today.  Even Geiger counter and scintillation tubes have virtually unlimited lifetimes.  So I would think that unless these night vision tubes are being pushed to their limits all the time, they should last longer than the published times. <br>
<br>
I'm surprised that there isn't the solid state equivalent to night vision tubes.  There may be, but I just haven't run across such circuits.<br>

			<P></center>The nearest solid state equivalent to a night vision tube CCD with high gain amplifiers.  The problem is they require more electronics that an intensifier and cost considerably more.  They have considerably better performace than intensifiers when used for long exposures but not for &quot;real time&quot; use.  The best CCD's do have better quantum efficiency than a GaAs (gen III) photocathode but the problem is that there is no solid state equivalent to the microchannel plate to give high gain from hundreds of thousands of parallel channels.<br>

			<P></center>The Universal Night Scope (UNS):<br>
<br>
Knightscope, Model 007, KAC P/N: 98621<br>
<br>
The UNS uses a Gated GenIII ANVIS-type tube, has adjustable gain, and uses two AA batteries. The optics are aligned front to rear to eliminate paralax, giving less than .5 MOA point-of-impact shift. The scope can be used mounted foreward of a day scope (ACOG, Leupold Mk4, etc), used by itself with a target pointer, aimpoint, etc, and hand-held as a pocketscope. The device has a throw-lever base to allow rapid mounting / detachment from a standard M1913 accessory rail.<br>
<br>
KAC recently won a $28 million contract to deliver units to US Naval Surface Warfare Center over the next five years. <br>

			<P></center>Hello All,<br>
<br>
I've noticed that most NV scopes come equipped with Weaver mounts.  However, some rifles use the Picatinny rails.<br>
Are they compatible or it is necessary to exchange the Picatinny rails for Weaver types?  Or, is there any adapter?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>
Cheers!<br>

			<P></center>Hi Mario, the difference between Picatinny and Weaver is only the spacing of the slots in the rail.<br>
<br>
Picatinny is a military standard and should follow this specification :- http://www.biggerhammer.net/picatinny/<br>
<br>
Weaver is the civilian version and the manufacturers put the slots wherever they think is appropriate.<br>
<br>
Apart from that, the two rails are interchangeable.<br>
<br>
<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>I will just continue...</b><br>by RJ<P></center>... as a resolt an ARMS mount with fixed mounting posts that align properly on your AR-15 Picatinny rail, may not align on your Remington 7400 weaver mount.<br>
<br>
It also comes into play when you mount the rings on your scope, their spacing may fit the Picatinny rail perfectly but not fit the weaver mount.<br>
<br>
I found you can sometime manage a happy spacing with scope rings where it fits the weaver, and also the Picatinny very snug fit.<br>
<br>
But a mount where the spacing of the posts are fixed, presents a problem.<br>

			<P></center>Not all Weaver bases are the same width as Picatinny. You will find this out when using the ARMS quick release mounts. They are made to exact specs for Picatinny M1913 Rails. You put them on some Weaver rails and they will not clamp tight. You will still be able to get movement. Also some Weaver bases have semi round slots not cut square slots. I have had to machine many &quot;Weaver&quot; bases to accept the square slot for a Picatinny mount. That will only work if the width is correct.   <br>
<br>
Bighammer has exact specs as posted<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 22, 2002, 8:36 PM<BR> from IP address 63.240.221.229</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035344188'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>  I ran across a website selling ITT Night Mariners 160's claiming the new models are improved with quick-focus and now use the same tube found in military goggles. http://www.night-vision-gear.com/en-us/dept_112.html<br>
<br>
  Is this why they've climbled from $1300 in 1996 to $1800+ now and are the improvements worth ditching my old one on Ebay and getting a new one?<br>
<br>

<br>
If you could buy a new unit with a return option, you could make a comparison and decide if the unit is worth the cost to upgrade.<br>
<br>
My understanding, the 160 would now have a 51 lp/mm commercial tube instead of a 45 lp/mm tube supplied before last summer. The 51 lp/mm tube might also have a 1200 photo response instead of the 45 lp/mm 800 photo response.  Are these improvements enough? IMHO no. For the same money, you could shop wisely for a 64lp/mm tube witha 2000+ photo responses in either a 7B goggle or monocular.<br>
<br>
Add in the fact that you can not upgrade a 160 tube, and you would not want to repeat your purchase over a system with greater upgrade flexibility.<br>
<br>
Ditch the 160 and look for  a used 7B with a 51 lp/mm mil-spec tube or better. The difference will be night and day.  sorry for the pun. ;-)<br>

			<P></center>with the metal adjusting screws on the power supply. I was told that this is an upgraded power supply giving somewhat better performance.  It is not the gen 2+ though,  as it is the standard 9916 intensifier.    It is a good working tube, however it is not in the metal housing.  Don't know if you need that or not.   There was one on ebay from Quecan very cheap,  but it appeared to be cracked and gone to air from the photo.   Could be wrong about that though.   Also www.wilcoxeng-res.com  may have some of those to sell.  He is a good honest guy to deal with from my experience with him.  I do have another one too,  I just remembered,  also out of the metal housing though.<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 20, 2002, 1:48 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.57</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035146924'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Now don`t get me wrong i realy think all the info and pointers given on this forum are priceless stuff. <br>
<br>
BUT. Some of the questions asked on the forum make me wonder what people want to do with there NV devices??<br>
<br>
Q`s like &quot;IR devices that can`t be seen by people&quot; or scopes that can see around coners or that work well in urban areas.<br>
<br>
Maybe its just my mind wondering of in tangents but it sounds like pritty questionable people post and get answered on this forum.<br>
<br>
ALL FOR FREEDOM OF SPEACH AND INFO but with the sniper in WS don`t you`s think maybe some questions might be asked before people reply to some of the stranger questions asked on the forum?<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>I thought......</b><br>by Interesting thoughts<P></center>they had found a shell casing at one of shooting scenes.  I might be wrong, I hope someone will correct me if I am.  But anyway, what I was getting at is, if they found a shell casing they should know for sure whether it is a 5.56x45mm (AR-15, Mini 14, bolt action, etc.) or a 5.45x39mm (AK-74).  But it seems like most of what you see on the news when they are talking about what type of rifle this nut is using, it's AR-15's a stuff.  So I would have though that means it wasn't an AK-74.  But then, if thats the case, they should have known that it wasn't an AK-74, and realized sooner that the bad information they were given was just that, bad information.  I guess I'll stop here, before I confuse myself, and others, even further.  I just hope it doesn't turn out that he's using some type of night vision or something, I know he shot at least one person after dark.<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 19, 2002, 10:25 PM<BR> from IP address 208.147.198.104</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035091558'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Do you really think those kinds of people needs forums like this one to &quot;learn&quot; how to do to kill people?<br>
How can I do to f..k the Cops?...<br>
really, do you think all the information left here can help in anyway all the criminals....<br>
they don't need the internet, I mean not those forums...<br>
they use the net to communicate, to live info to their members( in case of criminal organisation) but they don't need the web to learn how to turn the switch of a PVS or if the&quot;street lights will affect my tube&quot;.....they have their own teachers for that, all around the world.<br>
and most of time, NVG are sold with an user manual, aren't they?<br>
I will not be surprised to learn when the police will catch him( I wish the sooner they can), than the sniper of Washington was formed by the US army.....<br>
is the future world of peace and without crimes in the ban of free exchange of the information and knowledge?<br>
Do you forbid the Bretzel in Washington, it's very dangerous when you are president in the USA.....<br>
<br>
watch your step....you might fall if you don't ...or maybe you'd better stop to walk?<br>
<br>
It's soon full moon, I think I will go out at night with ny NVG, better thing to do than reading this on the web......................<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 19, 2002, 3:59 PM<BR> from IP address 80.13.75.213</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035068369'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Try keeping your mind firm and disciplined in looking at the situation, and make your analysis based on what is PROVEN THROUGH EXPERIENCE,(history) not some bs emotinal herd nodding it's freaking heads up and down, mooing all together to &quot;feel&quot; more comfortable with an uncomfortable situation&quot; thing.......I don't for the life of me understand why people like you don't understand that you are allowing 1 or 2 individuals to advance the cause of more control, more regulation, etc., things which have historically proven negative consequences. You must study this, grasshopper...... Spend some time with the REALITIES, unpleasant though they are, of human nature, motivation, and behavior. Why is it that after a tragedy like this, that anybody at all listens to the FOOLS who want to take guns away from everyone who DID'NT do it? JUST FREAKIN' CATCH THEM, OK? Nothing else thankyou very much, do you really expect AMERICA to follow the example of the UK and Oz, where all the sheeple just line up to turn in their guns following one horrific episode, and then just by freaking coincidence the violent crime rates skyrocket???? As for your insinuations about people on this board, you have'nt been reading too carefully,or you should have figured out that the majority of regulars seem to be people who are active in the NV industry, business owners,ex (or ACTIVE) military/law enforcement in some cases, and I don't see on the news anywhere about anyone USING that type of equipment as you suggest we should all worry about, so until that happens, how about if you control that overactive &quot;ninny&quot; reflex thing you've got going and stfu? :) Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you're really a very nice guy,but.......

<br>
I live in Ireland and because of the north of the country we here have the toughest gun laws in the world.My god i would love to be able to get a gun over the counter or have to wait the (is it 30 days) instead of waiting months to get a licence for a gun which then has to be renewed once every year.<br>
<br>
All i was trying to say was that if people on the forum take the time to question some of the questions asked which seem slightly strange in nature it might help to stop some one using NV in the future and so protect NV coming into the spotlight of the anti gun groups as a new target for them.<br>
<br>

			<P></center>II-B's got a point Ian. Here in the UK 'self defence' is a concept that was legislated away many years ago. We are brought up with a set of prejudices that simply don't exist in the USA.<br>
 <br>
Our mindset isn't &quot; kill the burglar, he left his human rights at the threshold of my property &quot; it's &quot; If I even hurt the burglar I'll go to jail, much better to be a victim &quot;<br>
<br>
So a question from someone in the USA who wants to use an NV device to observe featherless bipeds with a view to keeping a 'tactical advantage' over them and maybe ultimately sending some lead in their direction doesn't automatically qualify him as a psychopath. He's probably a normal guy who wants to protect his family and property. Maybe one day he'll have to protect them from elements of his own government, weirder things have happened....<br>
<br>
No parallels should be drawn with that loser ( I won't call him a sniper - a sniper is a trained professional who goes into harms way to protect his buddies, that guy is simply an inadequate or a NWO stooge ) in Washington. <br>
<br>
The UK government hasn't only disarmed it's people physically, it's also disarmed them mentally. Anyone with an interest in guns or technologies that could be described as 'military' is presented to the sheeple as a ticking time bomb. Victims of crime are told to lie down and take it, those who fight back are made an example of with jail time and compensation payments to the perpetrator. We are a nation that has been successfully turned into a homogenous grey mass of consumer robots.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't like to see UK attitudes like the above ( or those of any country where people are told to be victims ) applied to this message board.<br>
<br>
I know you live in Eire, the above is just my perspective from the UK...<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 20, 2002, 5:13 AM<BR> from IP address 62.254.0.9</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035115987'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>If you you live in Northern Ireland....</b><br>by Ex-11B<P></center>then I completely understand why you think the way you do, given the realities of existence there over the last few decades, my sympathies.........I was not really speaking to a European(or Irish) perspective here, those of us here in the former colonies who are well informed, and even some who are not, are well aware of how things are over there, I think Sid can be nominated as the board ambassador to one Sid or the other (haha)as I feel he has explained this probably better than I could have without appearing to come down quite as hard. I did indeed read your post, that's why the core observations in my reply are there, and I stand by them. If the taste is too harsh,well, then I am not qualified, nor do I wish to be, to offer further advice, as I have always preferred a diet of reality to the fare offered by one's own pride. People raised in Christian households are aquainted with the idea of pride going before a fall, but the fact of the matter is that a certain amount/type of pride is required to stand upright in this life and to be a free man/citizen. To be a(sub)ject is to be measured by one's ability to be(sub)servient..........&quot;Any man can be my equal, but whether or not he is my better, only I am qualified to judge&quot;, and every man everywhere has the right to believe in that(but if you do not take your rights, other's will take them from you) if he's willing to stand up for himself. This is an attitude that does not intrude on others, but likewise books no intrusion.....how's that for a recipe for &quot;whirled peas&quot;? Like I said, I'm sure you're a nice guy, but nice guys are usually the first to voluntarily surrender their rights,never to regain them, because they want to continue to be nice, reasonable guys. I'd LIKE to be a nice guy, but to me, a lot of that depends on others......Cheers. <P><center><i>Posted on Oct 20, 2002, 3:45 PM<BR> from IP address 66.183.13.50</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035153918'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I noticed that the individual has changed to 3 day auctions probably so no feedback is ever seen. That reakky should'nt matter since the seller changes ebay ID everyday. The funny or not so funny part is people are bidding (mostly new ebay members) on a set of AN/PVS 7U's. He/she is now also a Zeiss Dealer, lots of money to be made there.  This individual is now using a Canadian ebay address and I would hope that maybe the Canadian authorities would get involved. It sure would be ashame if any money gets forwarded from these unsuspecting bidders. I can't quite understand why a reserve is on all of the auctions but that in itself protects some folks. Watch for other copycats and scams to be appearing soon. I have my eye on a few other suspicious auctions not dealing with optics or nightvision out of Canada. Bidders beware.

I have been warning other bidders to other auctions.<P><center><i>Posted on Oct 23, 2002, 5:26 AM<BR> from IP address 216.221.81.97</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1035376005'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

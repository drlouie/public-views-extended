On a starlit night, no moon, I was easily able to see over 200 yards without the IR illuminator. The crosshairs are very sharp, but the brightness control needs to allow for an even dimmer setting. <br>
I haven't had a chance to shoot with it yet, but I know I will need a more consistent aiming technique due to the greater degree of crosshair movement when slightly moving my head when viewing.<br>
I had this scope hand picked before I purchased so maybe this is an exception, or maybe this model is superior to their other models. This model does have a 3 year warranty. Who knows.<br>
Now to find out how the automatic brightness control handles the muzzle blast. I'd hate for the scope to shutdown for a few minutes with a pack of coyotes running around in the dark around me.  <br>

			<P></center>but for that particular one I am surprised, but with the snow and some ambient light, it makes more sense now.  The snow really lights things up and makes for a uniform bright background unlike a dark grassy field or brush.  If it is a real gen 2+ it should do pretty well out to about 200 in those conditions.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 9, 2002, 8:38 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.60</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039495093'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>windage and elevation controls (and reticle, of course) BEHIND the image tube.  The PVS-4 has its reticle and windage/elevation controls in front of the image tube.<br>
<br>
The 343 is not as accurate as the PVS-4, and has alot of parallax.  The PVS-4 has almost no parallax.<br>
<br>
I prefer my reticle and elevation controls IN FRONT of the image tube, for various reasons....as does the military!<br>
<br>
That is why these commercial scopes all have &quot;red on green&quot; reticles, they can have any colro they want, since the reticle is superimposed over the green image.<br>
<br>
You cannot do this on the PVS-4 (and other mil weaponscopes) because the lit reticle is in front of the image tube, and whatever the image tube sees is green.  that is why the reticle on the PVS-4 is white.<br>
<br>
Handle both scopes, no comparison in my opinion.<br>
The 343 will have a nice Gen III tube, and the Gen III tube is very expensive for the PVS-4 (and still only 45lp/mm, but nice!)  The 343 can have a wide variety of tube resolutions, whatever you wish to pay for.<br>
That is the positive side.<br>
<br>
But when you compare the quality, accuracy, optics (PVS-4 has the best NV optics of any scope anywhere, period), reliability, etc.  there is no comparison, the PVS-4 will win hands down.<br>
<br>
I had a 343 and took it to the range.  My PVS-4 in Gen II was more accurate than the 343 in Gen III!!<br>
<br>
Proof is in the shooting..<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Let me disagree...</b><br>by franco<P></center>Hi Jason,<br>
<br>
Basically most newer military NV scopes presently issued in USA have a rear projected &quot;red on green&quot; reticle.<br>
The Aquila III, PVS-12/12A, PVS17, Ranger just to name a few use a rear projected reticle, and also the PVS10 should, since it uses zeroing turrets located next to the eyepiece.<br>
I really dont think that the US Military is making a mistake because is not using rear projected reticles in issued NV scopes; the few that do have front projected reticles, such as the PVS20, are so just because of backwards compatibility issues.<br>
There is no such thing as &quot;inherent inaccuracy issue with rear projected reticles&quot;...  it is just an issue of quality, workmanship, and materials, and ultimately cost.<br>
<br>
I believe the 343 is less accurate than the PVS4 only because it is a quite honest commercial product, but not up to mil spec equipment.<br>
<br>
As usual, it's just IMHO, and I may be wrong....<br>
<br>

			<P></center>and there is the issue of front projected reticles damaging the tubes with continuous use also.  The accuracy issues associated with rear projected reticles is partly due to lower cost design and in some cases this can be overcome by consistant shooting.  I and others have not had problems shooting consistantly with these scopes even though they can have these parallax related problems.  You can actually have the same issues with regular daylight scopes with inconsistant shooting.  Of course the PVS-4 is still nice,  but when faced with the issue of new with warranty buying,  is it worth the extra money to buy the PVS-4 gen 3 with lower performance image tube?  I guess that is a personal decision one would have to make based on what kind of shooting you plan to do with it.  $2500 compared to $5000+ is a big difference.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2002, 9:16 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.218</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039324596'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>There is no reason a rear projection reticle has to be less accurate than a front projection design.  The fact that some models do have rather severe parallax problems is just sloppy design or construction.   Using a front projection  reticle does guarantee that there can't be a parallax problem related to eye position, but it doesn't guarantee that the reticle will be in focus or will hold zero. <br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>343</b><br>by code-1<P></center>I have two 343's right now. My first is just over two years old and my second is just a few months old.I have had no problems with them and they are a great commerical  NV scope.A military scope like the PVS-4 is very nice and no doubt tougher as I have had 2 of them over the years in gen 2 and  gen2+.For the money the 343 or 441 which some people like better is hard to beat for the money.I can shoot 50 cent peice groups at 75 yards with my 10/22 and 343.Thats good enough for my use and I could not shoot that good with my PVS-4 mainly because I had a problem with the front lit crossarrow being  thicker and blocking very small targets unlike the super fine 343 style red lit crossarrow.I have not got to play with a pvs-4 in gen 3 but have seen a raptor before and it was nice.The main problem I would see with a 3gen pvs-4 would be the higher cost.Other than that it is a great scope,but I would take a 343 anyday over a gen 2 PVS-4 mainly because of the better clarity.Also my new 343 is a 64 and the tube in it compared to my first 343 with 51lp/mm the 64 is a whole lot brighter on very dark nights.it must have more photo sens and singal noise with the newer tube.The only thing I would not recommed would be a AMT 6600.I had a chance to look at one of these with a 64lp/mm tube in it last week and was not very impressed with it's performance.I wonder where they get the tubes as I have seen 3 units this year and they were all not to great.Maybe someone has one thats works good out there I have not seen one myself though.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 8, 2002, 3:04 PM<BR> from IP address 24.117.114.47</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039388694'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Pretty close to that price range,  and much better performance than anthing you will get in that range,  as it will be either gen 1 or used gen 2 tubed stuff.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 6, 2002, 2:34 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.225</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039214044'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Hi,<br>
<br>
I played around with IR-LEDs a little bit and built a tiny circuit board for a blinking IR-beacon. The LEDs I use are working at 950nm (the specs say +/- 25 nm wide), so they are at the lower end of what night vision devices can see - totally unvisible for the unaided eye. I guess I could see my beacons over a larger distance by using LEDs with shorter wavelength, but then they would produce a red glow. Take a look at my beacons, camouflaged as filmboxes :-)<br>
<br>
http://home.foni.net/~frankpl/ir/ir.html<br>
<br>
BTW I already have a PIC processor running, which allows 6s (later more) of recording time. The (morse-) blink code is being stored in EEPROM, so it does not get lost, when you disconnect the battery. I will try to design a small board for that circuit over the christmas holidays...<br>
<br>

			<P></center>Hi Lou,<br>
<br>
I have no idea - I read about the programmable Phoenix beacons and just wanted to proof that I could build a comparable device by myself. Currently I have a PIC processor running with a recording time of 12 seconds and the data being stored in EEPROM (keeps the message for about 100 years). What about entering the morse letters &quot;can you see me ?&quot; :-)<br>
<br>
No, just kidding, I could think of applications with additional hardware, like a temperature or other sensors, transmitting data via the IR-LED (morse letters giving temperature values or messages like &quot;door open&quot; &quot;on/off&quot;...). <br>

<br>
I can shoot 5/8&quot; 5-shot extreme spread groups at 100 yards with my PVS-4 Gen III scope, which is a little over 1/2 MOA (for five shots, not just three!) on almost any night.<br>
<br>
I have shot 2 1/8&quot; 5-shot groups at 200 yards, no problem.<br>
<br>
Price is around $2800 - $3500, well within your budget.<br>
<br>
They are out there, finding one is sometimes difficult, but good things come to those who wait!<br>
<br>
I don't think there is a unit out there, except the Raptor, that will compare in quality build, accuracy, and reliability.  Also, PVS-4 parts are very inexpensive, and there are so many scopes out there that parts are easy to find.

			<P></center>I can price you a 343 64lp for well under your high mark, email if interested.  A monocular with optical dot sight works well and can be worn head mounted.  I am not sure if those type of sights are available in 4x or not.  The D-300 monocular with P-500 weapon system works well too,  but is only 3X.  Available in 64lp for well under your high mark.  <br>
  I have used the 441 with no parallax problems, others say they do have that, and it can happen if you are not consistant.  I shot just over 1&quot; groups at 100yds, moonless, cloudy night with a 45lp one.  The 441 and 343 reticles are very nice and fine and adjustable.  Gen 3 PVS-4 is a good choice if you can find one used in that price range.  New they are very expensive, so you would have to find a good used one and take the risks involved. They are limited in resolution and tube performance compared to others that use ANVIS type tubes however.  36 and 45lp resolution on them, but they do have great optics.   They are about the same size as the 343,  of course built military tough.  <br>
Raptor 4X is available right now at a pretty good price, though still higher than your posted range.  They are awfully nice though.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 6, 2002, 7:27 AM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.113</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039188473'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>tubes in weapon sights is that you must be very careful of which ones are in there.  Apparently the PC to MCP tolerance is very tight in order to reduce the halo,  so you need to check the halo numbers and if it is less than 1 it is probably going to fail from recoil.   As for the lifetime,  that is still a point of contention.   There has to be some reason they went back to thin film!  Not like the unfilmed was just a flash in the pan type of thing.  They have been around for a while now,  and now discontinued completely for some reason!  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2002, 10:37 AM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.170</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039286247'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>specifically states not to point it at people closer than<br>
100 yards.  That's a Vietnam era light.  The IR mode was used to illuminate an area (typically a mile away) on command of snipers calling the requests by radio.  It worked well with the GenO through GenII scopes available then. The term was &quot;pink light&quot;. It could also be used in the visible mode thhough the sniper had to be more careful of his concealment when the light was requested, but he could use a regular optical scope. His chance of detection was still low, and the light prevented the enemy from seeing his muzzle flash.  <br>
<br>
Having a light that bright close to an observer doesn't work well because there's too much backscatter from aerosols.   That's a problem with any light more than a about a million candlepower, including laser illuminators of 100milliwatts if you're trying to view over a few hundred yards. Candle power is a function of how well the beam is focused, not just the total power.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 8, 2002, 7:29 AM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039361361'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I saw one a few years ago when it went on the market. there is a red light seen when it is &quot;on&quot;.<br>
it is very low intensity but you are not fully covert in darkness.<br>
the IR cover for 6P, 9P and other with the same diameter is more covert, you don't see anything throught but the lenghtwave seems not to be accurate for the NVG I had then. the &quot;light gain&quot; was better with the IR illuminator than  the IR cover in total darkness with the Gen II goggles I had then.<br>
I think the only covert system is a military IR light from a PVS assy( 5,7,14 or other)or a set of High intensity IR led that are fully invisible by the human eye.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 5, 2002, 9:11 AM<BR> from IP address 80.14.118.226</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039108293'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>have not found one that will have any distance that when you look back you can't see a red glow. This includes a SureFire 6V IR Illuminator that has a working distance of about 100 yards and is much more powerful than the SureFire M-1 version (30 yards) with one 3V battery. The M-1 will glow red and be seen within the working range of the unit by the night adjusted eye. The wavelength is about 830nm +-? at the center but the amount of visible &lt;780nm &quot;red glow&quot; is still visible at working distances.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 6, 2002, 2:38 PM<BR> from IP address 152.163.189.132</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039214330'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>very nice. Of course the color is not 100% pure or correct, but whatever the actual differences are,  the image seems much more clear and vibrant.   I did go out and try it from the outside looking into the lighted house,  and it was amazingly clear.  Of course good daylight optics would be too.   I cranked up the IR and was surprised it did not glow back from the glass.  I am going to have to mess with that more,  as I was sure it would.   The color NM came with a nice little 25mm objective WITH the CS to C mount adapter.   This lens appears to have a very nice coating,  which may account for some of the improved performance.   I will get some images saved as time allows.  I wish I had a way to save one from outside the house looking in,  just for the voyeur question from before.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 5, 2002, 9:21 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.219</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039152079'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>that I know of are internal fogging or frosting on the lenses.  There are others on the forum far more knowledgeable than I, they might know if there are other signs.  I have been trying to learn about purging recently myself.  If they don't fog up internally, that does't mean for sure they still have nitrogen in them, because I have not had any fogging on my PVS-7's and I'm sure they don't have any nitrogen in them.  I opened them to put a tube in them recently.  I have been trying to get set up to nitrogen purge my own set.  Did you buy them new or used?  If they have ever been opened they have definately lost their purge.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 6, 2002, 11:15 PM<BR> from IP address 213.149.175.70</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039245323'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

I've put together an intensifier eyepiece for a<br>
20&quot; Dobsonian using a MX-9644.  We've been experimenting with different filters for astro use<br>
and have gotten some good results.  But now we're<br>
curious as to how the Gen III cathodes might work<br>
with our filters, and whether it would be worth the<br>
money to shell out for a Gen III tube.  <br>
<br>
So I'm wondering if anyone has a Gen III tube with<br>
a burned phosphor screen they would part with for<br>
cheap.  We just need enough usable screen image to<br>
evaluate the filter response...<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
I want to replace my Gen. 1 goggles with some newer US technology, I have never used anything other than Gen 1 technology.  I use my goggles for astronomy, wildlife watching and maybe sometimes for checking out my neighbours wife undressing in the window (my god, she is SMOKING HOT!)<br>
<br>
Anyways, I want to know how much difference there is between Gen 2 and Gen 3 to justify such a massive price increase (70%-130% more!) for Gen 3 equipment.  Most of the Gen 3 equipment has whopping price tags while the Gen 2 stuff is much more reasonably priced.  I have heard from others that it is comparable technology.<br>
<br>

I don't know what your setup is like, but this seems to me like what could be happening:<br>
<br>
The light from the eyepiece is shining on your face, reflecting to the floor, being picked up on the cathode. The screen gets brighter till the power supply shuts off from overcurrent, then it starts up again and repeats. (blinks)   Put on an eyeshield it probably won't do that.<br>

			<P></center>&quot;Holding up&quot; isn't the problem.<br>
<br>
NV scopes mounted behind &quot;daytime&quot; rifle scopes don't provide very good night performance.  It's a simple optics problem, not anything wrong with either a Nightforce scope or a PVS-14.<br>
<br>
A Nightforce scope has a 56mm objective. A 6X raptor has a 100mm objective. Right off the bat that gives at least a factor of three light loss using the Nightforce with a PVS-14 relative to a Raptor. You also have lots of extra lenses to go through which really aren't desiged to be used that way.  Plus you'll have real problems with eye position and keeping everything lined up.   If you want a good weapons scope go with the Raptor   Use High quality quick release mounts to switch between the Nightforce and the Raptor. <br>
<br>
For what it's worth, peak acceleration is what kills scopes.  Heavy .50BMG's are no harder on scopes than some much lighter hunting rifles in small calibers like 300 Ultra.<br>

			<P></center>I think there are some other points that should be mentioned with regard to the question asked.  I know you know most of what I'm going to say, but I don't think the original poster does.<br>
<br>
.50 BMG rifles, including the M82A1, use pretty effective muzzle brakes to get the total recoil impulse down to bearable levels.  It seems to be typical that these, at least the ones I've seen accelerometer data for, produce peak accelerations in the forward direction of about the same level as in the aft direction, though of around half the duration.  I don't know how most NV equipment will respond to that sharp reversal of acceleration, but it sure plays hob with conventional scopes, reducing most to rubble in just a few shots.  Considering the more complex masses, all the connections inside my PVS-14 and the amount I paid for it, I'm not willing to find out the hard way.<br>
<br>
The M82 family, being recoil operated with the sights mounted on the receiver, will isolate the sights from these peaks a little.  Judging by the felt recoil of a friend's M82 compared to my single shot .50s though, the effect isn't huge.  I'd be leery of bolting an expensive piece of gear on one unless I could find out from someone with actual experience with the NVD and rifle I was interested in.<br>
<br>
And with regard to using a PVS-14 behind a high magnification rifle scope: yes, you do lose some light and contrast, but I still find it quite workable with either illuminated reticle scopes (NXS is what I'm using) or one of the Leupold Vari-X IIIs---as long as the PVS is solidly mounted behind the scope.  I would note that it's a pain in the behind to set the rifle up this way because it's nearly mandatory to move the scope at least 6 inches forward from it's daytime position to make room for the PVS.  Doing this of course raises the possibility of a zero shift in moving the scope.<br>
<br>
Is it as good as a Raptor at night?  No. Not even close. Lot more versatile though and a lot less expensive.  I admit I keep thinking about a parallel duplex mount of some sort to allow rigid mounting of a Raptor next to the NXS.....<br>
<br>
Do you know of anyone with actual firing experience with a PVS-14D on any .50 BMG rifle?  Or the Raptor?  Lots of usage of both on .223s and some on .308s, but response seem to drop to zero when I ask about .50s. <br>

			<P></center>I fully agree with Lou.<br>
An ideal solution in my opinion is a dediacated Day/Night scope (Litton PVS 10; we'll have comparable model in 2003). If not, a Day/Night with interchangeable eye piece (we have one, also ATN, ITT, others)<br>

			<P></center>I'm no &quot;expert&quot; but I have done a lot of stuff.<br>
The thing that has always struck me about the day/night combo scope is it violates the KISS rule.<br>
<br>
What's proven to me is a good picatinny rail and a quality day scope with QD attachment and a quality night scope  with QD attachment is less prone to screw up or head west in one way or another than a combo unit.<br>
<br>
Always seemed, so far anyway, that a &quot;combo&quot; ends up being just slightly less than the two individual devices it stemed from.<br>
<br>
I am, however, open to new ideas. Some do prove out, but in my experience, the majority don't. <br>

			<P></center>here are individuals,  actual vendor/dealers cannot advertise on this forum.   As for the actual question involved in this thread, it was answered in part very well by Lou,  but I don't think he mentioned the original question which was how would it hold up.  The answer is:quite well, depending  on the type of mount used.  The recoil would not injure the PVS-14 device, however continued rapid fire with some sort of muzzle brake might cause flash problems to the intensifier after a while.  Probably all NV weapon sights including the Raptor have had internal failures due to recoil,  but then the Raptor as well as others including the USNV D441 have been used repeatedly on 50cal and other large weapons with very good results.  Not by me personally,  so I did not answer originally because the poster was specific about actual hands on experience with the exact items he mentioned,  which leaves out a lot of us who do not own 50cal weapons.  That doesn't mean everyone but you is stupid though, just that we may not have the exact information the guy was asking about. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 4, 2002, 8:27 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.41</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1039019278'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Paul's info is helpful.  The accelerometer data on .50 BMG rifles (not the Barret M82) that I've seen did have peaks around 500 Gs.  Lots of dangerous game rifles have higher peaks, but much less duration than the .50 BMG.  Those few I've shot personally (nothing more severe than a .458 Win M70 that weighed maybe 8 1/2 pounds and of course had no muzzle brake) had much more severe perceived recoil than either of my .50 BMG single shots (both in the 25 lb general class).  <br>
<br>
These rifles without the muzzle brakes though don't seem to be especially hard on scopes, and I would not expect them to be especially hard on night vision equipment.  The difference with the .50s (all except the M82 family) is just as the rearward acceleration is tailing off and everything is loaded as far forward in its mounting arrangments as it can get, an essentially equally severe (in peak acceleration, it is shorter in duration) forward acceleration pulse arrives as the bullet clears the end of the barrel and the gasses are diverted by the brake.<br>
<br>
Thus any clearance created by compression or springiness (as in resilient mounts for lens cells or intensifier tubes!) results in impact shocks when the forces are quickly reversed.  This is very similar to another well known phenomena: spring-type air rifles destroying very high quality scopes that cheerfully tolerate life on a .458 Win Mag---the spring piston charging forward causes recoil to the rear, which instantly reverses direction when the piston runs into the cylinder end wall buffer.<br>
<br>
In other words, it isn't just the peak G's, it's the double pulse in opposing directions rattling them to death.  Even though the impact shocks of small bits in a rifle scope or NV device will have very much less energy, the peak loads can actually be much higher than 500 G's.  Things like lens cells, switches, anything with a spring in it, get pounded to pieces quickly.<br>
<br>
The reason the Barrett M82 gives it's optics a much easier ride is simply that the optics are mounted on the main housing, and the barrel/barrel extension/bolt/carrier etc recoil separately within that housing, coupled only by the recoil springs and the buffers that stop the motion.  The forward acceleration pulse from the muzzle brake arrives while the barrel is still moving to the rear and the scope sees literally none of it---just the recoil spring-coupled aftward acceleration being reduced as the barrel mass slows.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the treatise, but if you're going to try your NV equipment on one of these, it may be useful to have some appreciation of what's going on with them.  Hope it helps a bit.<br>

			<P></center>well i did receive an email from brian on 11-26-02 {after my first post here about the scam they're running} that cem-lites were on the way and he also included a tracking that DIDN'T correspond with ups or usps and NO i still have not received my chem-lites. i received an email stating that he was still posting items for sale on other boards, oh and reason given was they just moved and was unable to access the internet, so if anyone runs across them on other boards let me know where and i'll post a scam alert there also.<br>

			<P></center>The P2 is a very basic device that is intended as an introduction to night vision.<br>
Expect a fair bit of geometric distortion, and moderate light gain - they really need the IR illuminator on to give a clear picture unless it is a fairly bright night (at least 1/2 moon). If it includes the IR and is still under warranty, 90.00 is a very good price.<br>
<br>
Best of luck,<br>

			<P></center>The PVS-4 uses either the two AA batteries with the adapter or the BA-5567/U Lithium.<br>
My PVS-5's also were designed to use the BA-5567/U Lithium.<br>
I use an adapter cap with my PVS-5's which accomodates the CR-123 3.0 volt commercial lithium with a greatly extended lifetime.<br>
Here's the question: So HOWCOME this type of adapter isn't used on the PVS-4?<br>
The CR-123 will outdo a pair of AA's anyday and be better in cold weather.<br>
Will the PVS-5 battery adapter cap fit the PVS-4 so it will use the CR-123 also?<br>

			<P></center>A little while ago, I posted a question about Nitrogen and someone (Lou Boyd, I think) said Argon was just as good a Nitrogen for purging.  I was wondering about the effects of CO2 for purging.  I did a little more research on the small aerosol cans of Nitrogen for wine preservation that I mentioned in an earlier post, and found out that they are actually a blend of N2, Ar, CO2.  I'm not sure about the petcentages of each.  Would CO2 be harmful in purging NV devices?  I'm not sure about it's properties, but I think it's used as an inert gas in other food preservation also.  I believe I was told that some gases can leak past the seal in a tube, causing damage.  I think that was helium.  Appreciate any thoughts.<P><center><i>Posted on Nov 30, 2002, 3:28 PM<BR> from IP address 66.218.45.3</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1038698934'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>I always thought they used nitrogen because</b><br>by John<P></center>it was the cheapest thing around?<br>

			<P></center>I remember you answering one of my earlier posts on purging, and you seem to be very knowledgable on the subject.  I think it was you telling me Argon was as good as Nitrogen for purging, wasn't it?  Do you think a mixture of N2, Co2, and Ar, would be okay for purging?  I'll probably go ahead and get some Nitrogen, since I'll probably be purging from time to time, but I'm still curious if that would hurt anything.  If not, might be an idea for someone who is only going to be purging once.

			<P></center>the life of the phosphor display is the product of time and intensity of the electrons comming from the microchannel plate.  Looking at small bright sources for extended time is more likely to produce damage than using the intensifier with moderately bright overall illumination as the power supply shuts down on total current.  A small spot can burn a spot on the phosphor. <br>
<br>
Looking at any bright light, be it a street light, your friend's IR illuminator, or even a bright planet isn't good for the tube, but if the image of the object is moving around on the phosphor it's not as bad as looking at a fixed spot such as from a laser sight where the spot is always present and always in the same place.  Just ask your friend not to aim his illuminator at you and don't look at him with the scope.<br>

 I have a PVS 4 that is in very nice shape. I parted it together over the last couple years. I got a new objective lens out of Shotguns News (Pacer CBS) it was new in the box. I got the housing/rear lens here on the forum and the Gen II tube came from Mike Lemate here on the forum to, it very clear. I wanted to upgrade it to Gen III after reading all of Jason Walker posts about how good his was. But the way i look at it the best i could do is 36pl in a 25mm tube and if i do find a Gen III tube it would cost me close to the price of a PVS 14 which is 64pl. I have been playing with the PVS 14 lined up behind a couple different scopes/aimpoints and its not bad at all. so unless someone out there has a really good deal on a Gen III 25mm tube i think i will sell my PVS 4 to start my next project (PVS 14). I'm asking 1200.00 plus 20.00 shipping (insured) for my PVS 4 and that come with a 5 day inspection period. Heres what you get:<br>

			<P></center>I don't think select fire firearms can be made by individuals anymore (since May 86).  I think only ones made or converted before then are the only ones allowed to be owned by individuals.  I believe there are a couple of exceptions, like using a pre-86 REGISTERED (can't put enough emphasis on that) auto sear.  Also, using a (already) registered reciever made or converted before May 86.  Anyway, my point is, I'm pretty sure, only the registerd firearms, or registered parts that are already out there are available to individuals, at least unless something has changed.  Selsct fire weapons made after 86 are considered post 86 dealer samples, and are only transferable between Class 3 dealers and government agencies.  It's been a while since I have researched that, and it's such a complicated topic, I could be wrong about any of that.  Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong.<P><center><i>Posted on Nov 29, 2002, 10:14 PM<BR> from IP address 193.251.139.70</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1038636860'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

My site is http://savvysurvivor.com and I have been selling jigs for completing the lowers for over a year now.  There are links at my site to various ATF FAQ about making your own guns.  You will find the links on the &quot;gunsmithing tools and jigs&quot; page.  Whatever someone might have in opinion about ATF, their website counts as an official government document and the links are the links. <br>
<br>
While I have gotten numerous threats and warnings from &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;conserned shooters&quot; on the subject, the bottom line is that we have not yet heard of anyone being busted for it as long as they were practicing some common sense.  If someone is looking at this as a way of manufacturing and selling guns, then they are probably going to be in for a disappointment. <br>
<br>
While you get the &quot;advantage&quot; of not registering an 80% lower, note that it is not cheap or easy to complete one either.  Even with a jig, you are looking at a full day in a reasonably well equipped hobby shop and the purchase of a parts kit to complete a gun.  This is considerably different from a one stop shopping parts kit with instructions and everything in one box.  What you get with the AR built on an 80% lower is the pride and independance of doing a whole lot of the work yourself.  It will probably not be the prettiest AR on the firing line, but if you build it that way, it is all you.  Not like the guys who just bought a complete lower and snapped it onto a complete upper.  <br>
<br>
You have to realize that there is no shortage of instigators out there who want nothing less than to create as much conflict between people and the ATF when they have the opportunity to do it.  I was in a storefront operation for about six months this year and was harassed by no less than four local agencies about ARs and in some cases the jigs, but the bottom line was that when they went whining to ATF about a guy who sold tools to make ARs out of unfinished lowers, they hit the brick wall of jurisdiction.  William Snelling is located in Nebraska, I am in Oregon, which made it an interstate issue and out of their venue.  ATF had approval of the 80% lowers and that was already a done deal.  Compound that with the fact that I had no local customers at all for the jigs and the local LE pretty much had nothing to fly with.<br>
<br>
Bob Stewart got set up and railroaded not because he offended the BATF per se, but because the people at Grizzly Arms wanted to keep him from continuing a lasuit aimed at them for stealing his marketing and design for the Maadi-Griffin rifles.  He had originally contracted them to build parts and had envisioned the Maadi-Griffin to be the do-it yourself .50 cal like the AR is the do-it yourself .223 rifle.  The people at LAR saw it another way.  They stopped his orders for parts, and simply sold the guns under their own name due to the fact that he did not have a patent on the guns.  What he did have though, was a trademark and the LAR Grizzly rifle was identical to the Maadi-Griffin rifle.  Only they had more friends at ATF and some people who volunteered to set Bob Stewart up on a felony posession of AR15 with M16 parts.  It was a weak bust, but Bob Stewart took an easy plea bargain which led to a small fine and little or no jail time as opposed to spending a bunch of time in jail and money on lawyers fighting the bust while he could have been out making a living.  As he saw it at the time, everything would probably be illegal within a few years and being a felon would not matter much.  <br>
<br>
Bob was pissed about the situation and although technically a felon, he served little or no time and got approval for the rifle kits he advertised in SGN.  Note that the Drasen family got busted a long time ago on some trumped up interpetations but they are still in the parts kit business as M&amp;A parts and Model 1 Sales (both split off of what was Nesard).  <br>
<br>
Bob was very active in the patriot community and an outspoken critic of the ATF and the government in general.  By the time they raided him for the second bust on admittedly trumped up charges, they had found a cache of illegal guns that included at least one select fire Uzi.  Funny thing is that a felon in posession of an illegal Uzi is not much different from Joe citizen in posession of an illegal Uzi, so he would have not been at any advantage with a castrated postban model anyway.  <br>
<br>
From what I understand, Bob is involved in a civil suit and still sells plans for the Maadi-Griffin rifle along with some other knicknacks from an ad in SGN.  There are about a half dozen makers of various parts which are compatible with the Maadi-Griffin design and to the best of my knowledge, none of them have been busted either.  <P><center><i>Posted on Nov 30, 2002, 8:28 PM<BR> from IP address 63.191.193.53</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1038716889'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>a concise non-bs account of what really was what.<br>
Any word of Sam Wayne Daniels and his wife or what they are doing. I knew Sam when he was in Atlanta. <br>
I remember the day the ATF came with a warrant for all of his UPS/FEDEX records but they screwed it up and the warrant was only for 6 months worth of records. That's all he would give them so they left an agent there and went to get another warrant. Sam took ALL of the remaining records and put them in the dumpster. Then threw 5 gallons of gas in the dumpster followed by a match. <br>
Boy were the feds pi**ed.<br>
Always admired him for that.<P><center><i>Posted on Nov 30, 2002, 10:05 PM<BR> from IP address 66.82.32.1</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1038722738'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>..I'd like to have some every night.<br>
it's amazing how the light reflects much more, your gen1 goggles seems to become a gen2+!!!!!!<br>
the snow increase the residual light reflectance( as It does for the UVa and UVb in daylight and you needs sunglasses.) the only matter for NVG might be the high level of humidity( if your NVG is not absolutly waterproof at long time) and the cold temperature that can affect the specs of electronics components( it is why there is some cold weather battery adapter for the PVS-5 for example).<br>
colder it is, shorter is the battery's lifespan, you just have to take more spare batteries.<br>
maybe you can have trouble with demist too in cold weather, but there is millions of solution for this, like azote purgin, demist shield.....<P><center><i>Posted on Nov 29, 2002, 6:11 AM<BR> from IP address 80.11.118.73</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1038579087'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Demist shield....</b><br>by DavidS<P></center>is usually an additional lens you put on the eyepiece, build in clear plastic material that is unaffected by the demist...<br>
but i know per experience you'd better find something like this to add to the FRONT lens too. when it snows, the hymidity level is very high while temperature is around 3/-2 C...<br>
the ones who were running at night under the snow with all combat gear in real combat condition( asking every second when you move if there is no one in front of you ready to shoot...)with your heart beatting 150kh/h and sweat in your back as it is only 0C outside know what I'm talking about.<br>
you will have demist on your eyepieces even if the unit is purged with azote or i don't know whatever gas inside.<br>
maybe one day they find a way to have soldiers that never sweat or fell afraid in battle...the better will be unbreathable guys....<P><center><i>Posted on Nov 30, 2002, 10:54 AM<BR> from IP address 81.48.38.128</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1038682471'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

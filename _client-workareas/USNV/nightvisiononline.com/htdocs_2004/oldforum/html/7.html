			<P></center>241K has the best tube performance,  PVS-4 has the best optics, reticle etc.  New price for new price, 241K is easily the best deal.  If you can find a really nice, clean, good working PVS-4($1000-$1300) that is not a bad  choice either, however the tubes in those vary greatly, 28lp/mm is the resolution, they are noisy too.   The 242 is similar in size and design to the PVS-4, using the same tube, however it is a commercial scope,  also discontinued.  If there are any left you could get a really good price,  however I was not at all impressed with the performance of them.  Overall they are ok, again, tubes vary and they do work ok, especially for the close-out price.  The 241K will have 36lp/mm and better sig/noise than the other two,  also much smaller and lighter.  Slightly less magnification, but it does have a built in IR which neither of the others has standard,  and they can all use it.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 24, 2002, 9:55 AM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.219</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040752501'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Purchased from Lanny last early summer approximately.  Honestly only put ~4-5 hours on the tube.  Excellent shape; weapon mount included.  <br>
Only reason for sale is because I'm a sucker and want to go with a PVS-14.  ;)  The credit card company loves me.<br>
<br>
Data sheet included of course.  Lanny currently has it, so he could give you the numbers off of it.<br>
<br>
Asking $1500 USD.  <br>
<br>
Please drop me a line at michgrad@hotmail.com if interested.<br>

			<P></center>...but there is a 3X objective lens that is an accessory, and is shown in the product list on this site.  However, to the best of my knowledge, it will NOT have a aiming reticule of any kind, since it is really a viewer.  Therefore, what I did is mount it behind a NV-capable Aimpoint CompM2.  Worked great, but if you have a killflash on the Aimpoint like I did, it does kill some of the light gathering by the D121M.  Therefore, if you were to use that setup, I'd recommend leaving the killflash off.  <br>
<br>
Another option is just using an IR laser, like the Corsak for example as you aiming mechanism.  <br>
<br>
I realize both of those solutions don't exactly turn the D121M into a true weapon scope, but they are viable options, depending on your application.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 25, 2002, 10:04 AM<BR> from IP address 24.93.46.156</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040839444'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

It would be fun to have something that would be able to be used as a viewer also. I'm having a lot of trouble deciding, cause I'm not near anyone that has a number of these devices, and it is a heck of a lot of money to invest sight unseen, as you well know.<br>

			<P></center>I was pretty much in the same boat, as I didn't (and don't) have a whole lot of experience with NV.  <br>
<br>
I originally purchased an ATN supposed Gen1+ scope (Mk-258, I think?), and it was junk.  It was actually reasonable for urban settings for viewing with TONS of ambient light, but out in the country or forest, it was useless.  Sold it to a local constable who wanted it for viewing in urban settings.  <br>
Anyway, that's when a buddy showed me his Litton M944A (I think).  Killer.  For the applications we use our NV for (Airsoft night skirmishes), a viewer is ideal because of the wide FOV compared to a dedicated riflescope.  I could keep my D121M with NO reservations whatsoever and still be happy with it, but I'm spoiling myself for Xmas and looking into Gen3 stuff.  LOL!<br>
<br>
Since I don't hunt coyote, I don't have any good thoughts to offer.  :)<br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck!<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 25, 2002, 12:08 PM<BR> from IP address 24.93.46.156</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040846888'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>a sight like that with 3X lens.   It does have an available 3X but no weapons system option other than the weapon mount that is with it.    They do work well behind the optical dot sights,  however I am not sure if you would get that range or not.  I have never tried this setup as I don't have any of those types of optical sights.  I understand they work well set up that way,  eotech, aimpoint, acog, etc.  You can go with the monolock setup, but you need to have a REALLY good daylight scope with super optics suited for very limited light,  and that is still going to be a serious trade-off from what I have heard.  I don't even have any really good daylight weapon scopes so cannot give first hand info on them.  I know with the ones I have,  in low light coupled to NV they basically suck.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 25, 2002, 7:47 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.195</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040874479'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

By my mind, I'm not an addict of a coupled day scope +NVD.<br>
if you want a pair of goggles , buy a pair of goggles, if you want a rifle scope, buy a rifle scope...<br>
the solution of PVS-14/18 +ML2 Comp is a compromize ( not bad ,it is true) but won't eaqual a real Night vision rifle scope.<br>

			<P></center>The Knightscope is in fact in production, but all units are going to fill a contract with SOCOM. Civilian sales will probably not happen for some time, and I doubt they will be available in large numbers. I have heard of pricing in the $7K range.<br>
<br>
The device should NOT be compared to a PVS-14. The sight was designed to allow use as a pocketscope/viewer or (primarily) to augment a day scope. The unit has a proprietary system that aligns the tube and optics front-to-rear to provide zero POI/POA shift, even mounted off-axis by a few degrees. It also has &quot;infinite&quot; eye relief, in that you don't have to hold your eye right up to the eyepiece. <br>
<br>
Like any other NV device, this is a tool, and it was designed with a high degree of user input (That is to say, Operators, not people who post on a discussion board) Some users may opt for this unit, others a Raptor, PVS-10, etc. It depends on the user and his task or mission.<br>
<br>
By the way, www.knightsarmament.com is not a website controlled or endorsed by KAC, it belongs to some &quot;internet entrepeneur&quot;.<br>

Yes, I work for KAC, and I feel my response was no more &quot;biting&quot; than the ones I replied to. If someone can post a response with a negative comment about a product I am involved with, I think its fair to allow me a chance to defend it. <br>

Got a question regarding PVS 5 objective and eyepiece lenses; I wanted to know the quality of these, especially in regards to the difference between them and a D-121 eyepiece &amp; objective.<br>
Apparently, PVS 5 lenses used quite a complex optical assy involving some six achromatic elements in the objective and four elements in the eyepiece.<br>
<br>
How does the optical assy keep up with monoculars like the PVS14 and the D121?<br>

			<P></center>...have been made especially to give the best performances with the MX-9916 UV tube.<br>
<br>
For the PVS-14, it is the same eyepiece and lens than the ANVIS-6, PVS-15 or PVS-18.(same lens for PVS-7 A/C)<br>
the differences are just about the rings and setting indications for the dioptric adjustment.<br>
I guess it is the best lenses aviable for the MX10160 genIII tube.<br>
the lenses should have been made to give the best in the tube wavelenght sensibility...<br>
<br>
I cannot tell you for the D121 but it is told to be a good NVD<br>

			<P></center>I think that though the lens elements may be similar in these models they are not the same.  The lens cells in the AVS-6, 7A, and PVS-15 and 18 may interchange, however the individual elements are not exactly the same.    I am quite certain the PVS-7B/PVS-14 objectives, though similar in performance are not the same in specifications or design.  The 7B ocular is unlike any of the others.   I have an AVS-6 objective in one hand and a 7A in the other(well not as I am typing actually,  and they will interchange, but they are not the same element wise. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 23, 2002, 7:50 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.32</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040701819'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I think you are right.<br>
it's logical that the cell elements might be different from a model to another.<br>
I think the DoD spent some millions of $ to have the best lenses for each different tube used( I mean ANVIS, PVS-14 or PVS-7 tubes).<br>
So even they are quiet similar in apparence, it should be evident the cell is made for bringing the best performances to each type of tube.<br>
I'm not a specialist, just a &quot;NV addict&quot; so I cannot tell you about scientific or technical datas...<br>
anyway, I'm not sure it will cleary increase or decrease the performances if you put the PVS-14 cell to an AVS-6 or to an another device..maybe a difference can been mesured on a test machine but to the naked eye, I'm not sure.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 23, 2002, 9:34 PM<BR> from IP address 80.14.29.75</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040708087'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Litton  v.  ITT</b><br>by harrison<P></center>Well it seems like my wife won't be able to get her PVS-14D in time for christmas which gives us more time to check options. Seems like the PVS-14 is overall more versatile than the PVS-7.  (If one could only have/carry one to serve as both face and weapon-mounted.) Is there an appreciable difference between Litton and ITT regarding visual quality, construction, or accessory availability?  Are they essentially identical and if so, why the several hundred dollar difference for similar specs? Thanks again,<br>

			<P></center>depending on which ITT you are comparing to. The NQ/PVS-14 is a commercial unit with commercial tube.  If you want specific characteristics above the guaranteed minimum you have to pay extra.   If you want mil-spec you have to pay extra.  I am not even sure you can get mil-spec from ITT right now either.  Litton uses different optics,  though they are interchangeable.   The Litton has the auto off feature and purge fitting too.   <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 21, 2002, 9:52 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.69</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040536361'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Thanks for replying! Our interest is in the 64+ LPS version. I am not sure what the purge system on the Litton is. Is the auto off a function that shuts off the NVG when it is flipped up? If so does it turn it back on when flipped down? I keep hoping the PVS-17 will come up available but I fear I am deluding myself! :-)<br>

			<P></center>all 64lp/mm minimum.   The purge system is simply a threaded port with a sealing screw that allows you to purge and fill the system with nitrogen. It is not a positive pressure system however.   Yes the unit turns off when removed or flipped up on the helmet mount.  It must be manually reset just like the PVS-7B/D.   The Litton exclusive stuff(7A, 18, 15) all come back on automatically too, when re-attached or flipped back down. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 22, 2002, 6:31 AM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.87</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040567515'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Image esthetics...</b><br>by RJ<P></center>... I have found the Litton tubes have a darker light trail if an ambient light source is in your field of vision. The affact of a sustained exposure appears to be similar between a Litton and ITT tube. However, I find the ITT rejects brief exposure affects much better.<br>
<br>
At the same time, the Litton tubes I have seen offer a slight edge in near total dark environment, such as treking in the dark woods.<br>
<br>
Personally I prefer the ITT esthetic because I can not totally avoid some ambient light sources. <br>

			<P></center>Here's a few pics of how I converted my 502 from it's/my original FN mount to use on my M16/M4. I used the TA51 ACOG mount. I had a buddy drill and heli coil the 502. This mount gives a perfect eye relief (my opinion) as the old FN mount was high and unable to have a cheek hold on the butt. <br>
Yes, I too spent time in the CF (Canadian Forces), however was posted to air bases as an Air Frame Tech.<br>
I have limited expertise with NV. I have tried approx 8 different makes, ie PVS2, PVS4 Gen2, Black Cat, Unitec, TNT Dark Star &amp; Python, PVS14D, all during the same night with the 502. And just like &quot;how long is a piece of string&quot;, all of my opinions are just that, opinions. However I do believe that the PVS 502 is an outstanding piece of kit, without even stating, for the generation, age and price.<br>

			<P></center>Thats good solid engineering. Did it hold zero OK mounted on the FN ? those top covers to the receiver are bit wobbly on the UK issue 'SLR'.<br>
<br>
3 stage Gen I is excellent in my opinion, I bought an Oldelft HV5X80AT a while back to replace one I used to own and always regretted selling.<br>
It's just the weight and the fact that you can't point the things anywhere near a light source that is the downside.<br>

			<P></center>It does sit about the same height as any other optics mounted on the flat top, ie Elcan, Acog, and gives me the same eye relief and cheek hold.<br>
It actually can't get any lower as the rubber retention rings for the reticule cover and daylight filter are just touching the picatinny rail. I gotta say, the last night we were out for the night shoot with all the different units, we also had 5 PVS502's. I was kind of the middle guy buying a bunch of them for my buddies. Half moon night, and the 502's kept up with everything except of course the 14D behind the Elcan. 502 was going for around $600 Can dollars (2 bucks U.S.$) So for my first NV toy and introduction to the world, I have spent a lot more for less..<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 21, 2002, 9:14 PM<BR> from IP address 66.222.204.134</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040534048'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Hello All,<br>
<br>
I just caught up with reading the last posts and must say I am starting to get thoroughly confused about the entire ITAR thing: <br>
<br>
Can a US company export a Gen 2+ device to Canada, or not? I think Gen 3 is prohibited.<br>
<br>
Reason is that I am in the market for such a device, and seem to get conflicting statements about this regulation. And so I went to the source, as I surely do not want to break the law.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to your comments.<br>

			<P></center>he bought them legitimately and since it is Christmas he needs the money for a nice gift for his fiance and is willing to take the incredible loss on them?   I am sure he would not advertise stolen military property on a public forum!   Wouldn't that be foolish.  Not to mention brand new helmet mounts at less than distributor price.   Of course those are probably surplus since the military doesn't have much need for them right now. Oh wait,  maybe they do have something going on in the Middle East.  Well, no matter they don't really need that stuff,  and the taxpayers don't mind footing the bill for a few more.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 21, 2002, 12:06 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.42</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040501169'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>This is semi related. Most of you that have ever dealt with the gov't, this will come as no suprise. I am a LEO and at one time was our department's screener for the Project North Star program. I tagged a case of large Alice Packs and two cases of Rain Ponchos. All brand new. The gov't gave these to our department. When I brought these back, one of our tactical medics saw them, he is a Major in the Army Reserves. He told me that his unit could not get any of these two items, but the gov't was giving them away. You would be amazed what shows up at a DRMO.<br>

The 4C clones youre talkning about are manufactured by a company in Japan. And they where PEQ2s not PAC 4C. Sadly these units where made in a very limited edition, also they where not available outside Japan.<br>

What you could do is to buy an AGNS/ICS PEQ2 and fit an invisible IR laser module in it.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 22, 2002, 4:30 AM<BR> from IP address 217.215.163.176</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040560247'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

the SOCOM MK23 from Marui is delivered with a LAM but the laser module is a fake and have only a red led in Place of the Laser diode.<br>
So I'm surprised the clone PAQ-4 or 2 will be only aviable in Japan????<br>
Anyway if it is really true, there is nothing you cannot have from Japan, just look at the websites about Soft air, sooner or later all items are aviable from HongKong or Taiwan.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 22, 2002, 9:34 AM<BR> from IP address 81.48.38.36</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040578444'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Its only the armstech PEQ2 replica that wasnt available outside japan. There are two manufacturers of PEQ2 shells, AGNS and ICS. Both can be fitted with a real laser, and are available from HK dealers.<br>

I dont know about the laser status in japan, but the marui wilcox unit was meant to use LEDs all along.

<br>
yes I knew all about ICS and ANGS PEQ-2<br>
I've build one for long to fit my batteries for my M4 RIS and a laser( visible).<br>
the ICS and ANGS fit a laser where it is the IR illuminator on a PEQ-2.<br>
For the japanese law about laser, I heard all lasers, visible and invisible( I mean IR) are prohibited.<br>
it happends here too for a whilre in France because it wasvery famous, people's have theim all everywhere and there were some &quot;accidents&quot;..(it is what was siad!!!??!!) anyway, only laser under class III are allowed here for sale to anybody and you can find stronger IR or visible laser diodes in electronic shop for industrial or specific applications.<br>
I can buy some using my work as we used IR led for electronic detection and invisible &quot;fences&quot;.<br>
<br>
I hope I will have more info soon about what is aviable there in Japan.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 23, 2002, 8:07 AM<BR> from IP address 80.14.29.75</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040659653'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Strangely I cant find any info on the laser ban in Japan. <br>
Since I live in Sweden, there are no regulataions for invisible IR lasers here. If you have a class 3 limit in France  I think youll be satisfied with a class 2 device.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 23, 2002, 4:41 PM<BR> from IP address 217.215.163.176</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040690476'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I have a Fuji lens with the same size thread as C mount,  and it works on most C mount devices,  however the lens model is a CF something.  It has a smooth surface that extends back past the threads,  which will now allow me to use the C to CS adapter rings on it for the Night Max.  Anybody familiar with this?  I will get the whole model number if it is needed.  I just wondered if it is some specialized use lens or something.  I would love to try it on the NM as it is an f.85 and seems to be a very nice lens.  I was told it was worth $450 or so when new,  which it still is.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 20, 2002, 9:14 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.153</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040447682'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>C-mount lenses</b><br>by DavidS<P></center>Lanny<br>
most of C-mount lenses are for use with CCTV /CCD cameras. they are build to have a wide angular view with a very low distorsion rate.<br>
those lenses are not specially made for NV tubes. the F/stop is not the only parameter that counts for image quality with NV tubes, you must think of coating and type of glass used.<br>
Now, for the NM, it is different while it use a CCTV low light module if I'm not mistaken. I don't see where is the matter is you can fit it on the NM without any adaptation unless the existing adapter. Maybe the settings for the FOV will be a little bit differet, as long as you have a quality image there is no problem with this.<br>
Now, you will be able to find larger info on the web, there are a few sites about C-mount lenses with reviews and tech datas of most existing lenses, just type the name and references of the lens into your seach engine field( I usually use Google.com)and you will be able to find what you need easily.<br>
Hope this helps<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 21, 2002, 4:36 AM<BR> from IP address 81.48.38.122</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040474200'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Both the CS and C type lens mounts use a 1&quot; x 32 TPI thread.  The difference is that the C mount is 0.69&quot;(17.625mm) from the face to the image plane while the CS is 0.4921&quot; (12.5mm).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately there is no specification of how the chamber behind the lens (but in front of the image plane) must be shaped.  If you screw a CS to C adapter into a CS mount it obviously has to make the chamber smaller in diameter. It's difficult to design a very fast short focus lens for a C mount which does not have a rear protrusion. Many CCD cameras use the CS front flange and ship with a C-CS adapter, and those very short very fast lenses just won't fit.<br>
<br>
C mount is an old design which was widely used on 16mm<br>
hi end film cameras (like Bolex) since the 1940's. (earlier perhaps, I don't know).  Manufacturers of NV<br>
gear SHOULD be aware of the problem, and there's no reason it should be a problem, but it is.  <br>
<br>
Fujinon (Fuji?) makes an f0.85 25mm lens which won't fit in a CS adapter.  It won't fit my NVPS-10 either.  Same for the rare and expensive Fujinon F/0.7 50mm lens.  I have a JAI low light camera which is &quot;true C mount&quot; and accepts both lenses nicely. <br>
<br>
The things you have to watch when buying a C mount<br>
lens include:<br>
<br>
1. Does it have a broad wavelenght range. Most all<br>
lens will pass the full range that NV equipment is<br>
sensitive to, (300 to 1000nm) but they don't necessarily have the same focus or geometry across that<br>
wide of wavelenght range.  Lenses designed for film cameras only needed to work from about 400 to 650 nm. <br>
Many CCD cameras have IR blocking filters to give crisper and more natural images in the daytime, but that's the last thing you want for trying to observe in starlight.<br>
<br>
2. Does the lens give adequate field coverage and low geometric distortion.  Fast short focus lenses often suffer from a &quot;pincushion&quot; effect, or simply have crummy focus off axis. It's hard to tell from the specs <br>
which are rarely complete wheter a lens will be good for NV use.  You just have to try them. Looking at the sky is a good test.  If the bright stars look like &quot;points&quot; across the field without halos then the wavelength and focus is good.  Then look a rectangular buildings and see if the sides and tops look straight. That's the quick test for &quot;pincushion&quot;.  Sweeping the scope across a scene may show some secondary distortions which aren't noticible when viewing normally, but they can generally be lived with.<br>
<br>
3. Is the physical characteristics of the lens.  Is it too bulky to use.  Is it too easy to accidelty change the focus or f/stop.  Does it screw into your NV unit. (the problem which started this discussion).  Again, the specs probably won't tell you that. <br>
<br>
The discussions about what lenses work well with what equipment on this forum have been good, but they haven't come close to covering all the possible combinations of lenses and NV scopes/cameras. <br>

			<P></center>there are two PEQ-2 made for Airsoft BB guns. designed to fit external batteries for the Tokyo Marui M4 RIS replica, those PEQ-2 are build by ICS and ANGS.<br>
the ICS is MSRP $45. it's only a box with a weaver mount and able to fit several type of batteries for the Automatic Electric Gun M4 (AEG). adding $35, you can fit a laser sight module in place of the IR illuminator.<br>
comparing to a real PEQ-2, the ICS is not very accurated and with a few &quot;look like&quot; differences.<br>
<br>
ANGS is well known for their accurate accessories to update the AEG such as TOP M249 Minimi,TM M4/AR15 series etc...<br>
<br>
the PEQ-2 they build is also a battery housing.<br>
it's really look like a real PEQ-2 and is much more accurated. MSRP is $95.<br>
<br>
with a few home work, it should be easy to build a real &quot;POOR man&quot; PEQ-2 adding a laser sight module( Corsak or converted visible Beamshot laser with an IR laser led) and a SUREFIRE IR illuminator.<br>
<br>
for more info:<br>

<br>
http://arniesairsoft.cjb.net/  for reviews about both PEQ-2 and lot of news about BB guns and Airsoft<br>
<br>
<br>
this is for those who can't pay thousands bucks into a real PEQ-2 of for Airsoft players who can get enough with this instead of buying real NVG and laser sight modules to fit on a BB gun....<br>

by my mind the best way, and cheaper, is to modify a visible laser sight with the right dimensions with an IR Laser Led you can find in any electronic shop.<br>
you just need to disable the laser module, solder the IR laser led in place of the visible one and you have an IR Laser sight module.<br>
I don't understand why people need to spend hundreds of $$$ to have a IR laser sight, unless you are rich enough or really want the expensive military stuff.<br>
Most of time, you just need a little bit of Home work to find a solution and have a more reliable stuff than the original one....<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 21, 2002, 3:33 AM<BR> from IP address 81.48.38.122</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040470400'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>ir led and ir laser not the same thing</b><br>by rob<P></center>ir and visable laser diodes are not the same thing as ir and red leds. not only do the laser diodes emit cohereant light which allowes you to focus the light into a beam but laser diodes also require driver electronics that are tuned to the current draw and light output of each laser when there put togeather. <br>
if you ever look close at a diode laser both visable and ir diode lasers have three pins (+,-. and a photo cell)if you try to run the laser on just the positive and neg legs it blows faster than you can turn it off.<br>
driver electronics are around that will run diode lasers but chances of getting one to work the first time are slim. raw diode lasers dont like static electricty, heat or non grounded work areas to mention a few <br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Well.......</b><br>by John again<P></center>First suppressors: You can buy one in Finland or England in a store without any paperwork. In fact they are recommended and desired to protect your ears. In America, they are forbidden unless you get the approval of a high-ranking police and go thru miles of paperwork and then if you get it, you pay $250 for the license and then if you go out of your state/county/shire with it you have to get permission to do so, so they know where it is at all time. In fact they can search your house at any time without notice to make certain it is still there. And then you can't sell it or even throw it away without their permission.<br>
As to IR lasers: you can buy them anywhere, so can we, sort of. But they didn't forbid the devices thru firearms laws. They went thru the food &amp; drug administration using the law that fears you may blind yourself or someone else. That's why the manufacturerers won't sell them and they don't get imported. Just another route/method of banning them<br>
What the powers that be fear is a capable armed equipped population of serfs that have military/police equivalent of firepower.

			<P></center>Just for the record, while a silencer is an over the counter item in the UK you need to get Police approval and then have it recorded on your Firearms Certificate before mounting it on a gun.<br>
At one time they only gave approval for silencers on .22RF used for vermin control but now it's regarded as being ok on virtually every calibre.<br>
<br>
While on the topic of gun laws, the UK Home Office recently admitted ( very quietly ) that the handgun ban has been a dismal failure in terms of preventing crime. Can't see it being reversed however, the liberal media have brainwashed too many of the UK population into believing that guns are inherently evil...you also have to remember we aren't citizens here, we are SUBJECTS. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 21, 2002, 12:28 PM<BR> from IP address 62.254.0.10</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040502514'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Anyway, we are on the way to produce few new ''IR laser sight/IR illuminator modules''. First one is nearly ready and you can have a preview here http://www.sovietbazaar.co.uk/lasersights_modules.htm<br>
Very simple - we made housing to accommodate Corsak-16 I laser sight and HTH 200 IR illuminator - it is called HTH 901, virtually unbreakable, a bit heavy. Everything is adjustable - power output for the sight and illuminator, beam width on the illuminator. Quick relies weaver mounts.<br>
There are few ''pro'' models on the way, will be in lightweight housing with some fancy fitches.<br>

One thread is all that protects the scope from dislodgement. Ditto for the head-mounting. Was the PVS 14 a stop-gap measure taken while awaiting the PVS-17? It just seems like the slightest trauma and the scope would &quot;snap off&quot; leaving the socket left mounted to the rifle? Anyone have any experience with this? It seems like if one could only have one night vision source, then the PVS-14 would be a good choice but only if it isn't excessively vulnerable to damage. Is the litton 983 a substantially better choice?<br>

			<P></center>the Litton 983 would be a better performing choice(in my opinion) the AN/PVS-14D is an admirable performer.  I have not heard of any breaking off the mount whether head mounted or weapon mounted.  I suppose you could break off the headstrap adapter or the headstrap.  Unlikely the housing itself would break.  The mount even with one screw is quite secure.  It is a super performing monocular.  All the accessories for the 983 are expensive and Litton exclusive.  Not that I am trying to talk you out of either one.   The 14 is much more attainable and you would end up with a bit less invested for very similar performance,  except underwater!<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 20, 2002, 9:53 AM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.240</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040406785'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>I'm curious</b><br>by bugeyed<P></center>as to why you feel the 983 would be a better performer then the 14d. If you were talking about the 985, which would at least be apples to apples wrt variable gain, well, I guess I would still wonder. I noticed no diff in the optics from a cursory exam of the data sheet on the website, but I'm half blind and mighta missed it. Also, isnt the 14d waterproof to 20m? it's milspec. And was that a couple grand $$ difference? big chunk for giving up 30 grams. Although I wonder if the flipup headmount would work on my 14?<br>
And, btw, I can from personal experience say Lanny is an excellant source if you are in the market.<br>

			<P></center>the 985 would be more similar as far as the gain.  I just liked the 983/5 better as it was a bit smaller, does not stick out as far,  personally I think the optics are a bit nicer. The 983/5 also has auto off/on compared to the 14's auto off/manual reset back on.  That really is a handy feature sometimes.   It's cooler looking,  can flip up with the flip up facemask,  is submersible, not the 14 is not except to a couple meters.  The 002 version has dive windows so you can actually see underwater!  Technically they are so similar that you really have to decide esthetically which one you prefer.  Price difference on the basic package,  985 to PVS-14milspec there is not a dramatic variation.  Somewhere around a grand, maybe a bit less. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 20, 2002, 3:03 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.153</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040425388'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>the same as the 14 isn't it?  I believe I read 1m or 30min. on that somewhere also.  Just curious, do you know why there is a time limit?  I would assume it's because they might leak ever so slightly and allow water to build up in them or something like that.  Is that the reason?  If so, it seems to me that 10 times of immersing them for 30min. would be just as bad as imersing them once for 5 hours.  I guess there might be some other reason though.  Anyone know why?

			<P></center>In order to &quot;certify&quot; a product for military use one of the criteria to be met is an accepted INDUSTRY / MILITARY standard for being &quot;water proof&quot; and for being <br>
&quot;water resistant&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't know exactly what that standard is (that is something our quality control and ceritification department would know) but industry standard test documents and certification proceedures must be logged an on file by Quality Control Dept. should a govt contractor ever get audited by GSA or other accounting agency.<br>
<br>
&quot;Water proof&quot; is only for a standard recognized period of time at a certain &quot;atmosphere&quot; (depth).  This does NOT mean that every single unit is tested to that standard, only the prototype (for certification) and then every so many of the production run for quality control verification.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Underwater night vision glasses (UW NVG): the principle of build-up and range calculation<br>
 <br>
Making of devices of observation under water represents more complicated problem in comparison with instruments of terrestrial application as character of image generation (forming) in the turbid water and the Earth atmospheric mediums essentially differs.<br>
At optimum system making for observation in water mediums it is necessary to take into account these differences and features to the full measure:<br>
1.      As a result of the strong attenuation of radiation by water medium in fundamental due to absorption, the visibility range does not exceed 50 m.<br>
2.      Due to selective absorption of radiation the turbid medium essentially changes a spectral content of radiation narrowing it up to 0.4-0.6 microns and cutting off an IR range of spectrum. It determines an optimum range of Night Vision Devices (NVD) operation in water.<br>
3.      Reflection ability of a surface of various materials at their dipping in water decreases, especially for dielectrics, approximately by an order. <br>
4.      Difference of refractive coefficient of water from 1 in case of application of a normal lens with an illuminator leads to variation of dimensional and aberrational characteristics of the lens. The lens in water has an accessory distortion, which exceeds 15%, the field of view decreases by 25% and a relative aperture by 45%. In water the focusing of lens for the subjects situated at a terminating distance is changed. Therefore special hydro lenses are applied to exclude these distortions.<br>
5.      Water represents by itself a scattering medium (hydrosol) and a nonuniform medium with random distribution of refractive index (as in turbulent medium). These features of water medium influence on the picture quality and should be taken into account at preliminary computations through the average empirical formula of a contrast-frequency characteristic of the sea. <br>
6.      Aggression of sea medium demands application for a NVD housing of special materials - composites or special protective covers.<br>
7.      The optimum scheme of building-up of night vision glasses (NVG) in terrestrial conditions is pseudo-binocular scheme. In water mediums with a view of the divers safety the monocular scheme of the UW NVG building-up is more expedient.<br>
8.      An essential problem is ensuring of hermeticity both the instrument and control equipment and also alignment of UW NVG with diving mask. The optimum decision is making a special mask with the built-in it instrument that provides distance of an eyepiece target pupil no more than 25 mm. In case of UW NVG jointing with a regular mask (outside of it) the distance of the target pupil exceeds 50 mm that essentially magnifies an overall dimensions of the eyepiece.<br>
In the a construction of the underwater night complex consisting of a night monocular with magnifying of one-multiple (1x ), an illuminator designed on the basis of a light-emitting diode module, a diving mask such as RTI and a system of fastening of the monocular to the mask is developed. The underwater night monocular includes: the Gidrobizar-2 hydro lens (f'=25 mm, O=1:1.3), an image intensifier tube of GEN 2+ or 3, an eyepiece (f'=25 mm, distance of a target pupil is 55 mm), a built-in illuminator on the basis of a light emitting diode and a built-in unit of power supply (U=3 V).<br>
Calculation of the designed UW NVGs range of working was carried out by the NVD calculating procedure applied in the which is taking into account influence of parameters of water on power (energy) characteristics and image quality of the watched objects. At the same time the geometrical distortions imported by water are not taken into account, as for their compensation in the Gidrobizar-2 lens the special optical elements are included. The carried out calculations of UW NVGs working range of the passive-and-active type have shown a considerable opportunity expansion for observation in water medium at low illumination levels.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 22, 2002, 8:36 PM<BR> from IP address 199.71.120.66</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040618182'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>NVG's utilized in flight have some interesting side effects. Once, we were all goggled up in central Georgia(state, not country) doing night flying at &quot;very low&quot; altitude and and we knew it was raining but when the gunner went visual, he sorta hiccuped and said I oughta unmask for a second. No NVG.... Couldn't see squat. Driving rain. Just totally socked in, full IFR, WE should have pulled pitch and contacted center for an IFR filing. Instead, we just re-masked and went on and landed. Both this time and during a forced landing in NE Texas in a hurricane squall line the nvg's got soaked but never did fail. The time in Texas, was daylight and we used the nvg's with covers on in order to see thru the dang rain. W/O nvg, we were totally IFR/blinded. Oh, in Texas we really did land on a pig farm and no, they didn't have any daughters(darn it).<br>

Which means it was $100, i.e. what you US guys would pay for it.<br>
<br>
What a complete and utter waste of money.<br>
<br>
It looks sexy with the grey anodising and it's built to survive a heffalump treading on it, but as a source of illumination it's bloody useless.<br>
The output is no better than the puny IR led's built into most every device around and actually worse than a few. It does have the advantage of being covert - i.e. so covert you can't bloody well see it with your NVD's after 20 yards.<br>
<br>
The ergonomics suck, the tailcap is difficult to move into the 'on' position and the alternative push button option is very stiff to operate and has no tactile feedback. Law enforcement use ? the thing is a liability, I wouldn't take it out hunting for rabbits, and they don't shoot back...<br>
<br>
I am kicking myself for being suckered by Surefire's marketing hype. I have Russian made LED illuminators which outperform this horrible thing at a fraction of the price, but oh no I had to waste my money because it looked so damn good in the picture. <br>

			<P></center>are piles of IR filter covers for those Million CP zenon lights that the army used to use on base camp perimeters, etc.   If anyone has a use for them let me know and I will see what the guy will take for them on a piece basis.  I am guessing very cheap.  They are glass,  sort of half a cylinder shape.  I guess they could be gone by now too.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 19, 2002, 7:20 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.231</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040354412'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I have not had the pleasure to use any cool Ruski LED IR lights but I do know that the IR cover for my streamlights and surefires SUCK,  they cause waaaaaay  too much blooming in my 7Bs<br>
<br>
The M1 has a nice tight focused beam that works great for cutting sign at night w/ the 7Bs on.  The filters just &quot;shoot&quot; light all over the place and cause to much light to come back at you off of the trees/brush/bushes.<br>
<br>
If you have an LED light that has a nice tight focused beam BUT has more range than the M1 <br>
<br>
PLEASE LET ME KNOW<br>

			<P></center>Get an IR laser, pull the laser canister out of it and rotate the collimating lens counterclockwise. Thats like unscrewing the thing. They all have a screwdiver looking slot on the nose cutting across the lens hole. Don't scratch the lens.<br>
The beam will unfocus and come off of the pinpoint, which is what &quot;most&quot; people want it to be, and you will have an ever growing circle. Stop it where you want the circle to be.<br>
If it's too bright, you can put a resister in the voltage feed circuit and adjust the brightness. You can't make it brighter than the original configration but you can reduce it to where you want it.<br>
Questions, ask.<br>

			<P></center>it takes two 3v c123 batterys. It is said to be 3-4 times the power of the M-1. It is an LED and I bought it for over a hundred dollars.<br>
<br>
It is not &quot;Covert&quot;. the Term &quot;Covert&quot; means to me that you can't see any trace with the night adjusted naked eye. Its kind of like being pregnant(either you are or your not). If you walk in front of the M-1 can you see the red glow of the emitters?? You can see it with the L-46 at 830nm center wavelength! &quot;go figure&quot;. Not ever having a SureFire M-1, I don't know for surefire:) but suspect you can readely see the glow??<br>
<br>
The range on the L-46 is a good 60-80 yards with a &quot;D&quot; tube Gen. III 7B goggle.<br>
<br>
Sid, I you may be right about the hype here, however, SureFire LED lights are the better ones. That being said LED flashlights have a long way to come in Light output lumens, whether IR. or Visible.<br>

			<P></center>Ok, I thought I might have been a bit harsh so I gave the Surefire another go tonight. <br>
<br>
Last night I was using a 3 stage Gen I weaponsight which has light gain approaching that of Gen II. Tonight I used a Gen III monocular, British tubed.<br>
<br>
The results were still disappointing, to me at least. Nicely focussed beam certainly, but it ran out of steam at 30 yards. I can definitely accept that used with a device which has really good light gain the Surefire would be OK at short range. For me the D-121 inbuilt illuminator is a much better option because it's more powerful and hands free ( and comes free of charge with the housing :-) )<br>
As a comparison I IR-filtered one of those tiny Solitaire maglights and it did almost as well as the Surefire.<br>
The Russian LED illuminator was a case of 'who turned the lights on'.<br>
<br>
Plan B is to get the Surefire apart and put a better LED in it. This isn't going well as the two halves have loctite from hell holding them together...<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 20, 2002, 3:30 PM<BR> from IP address 62.254.0.10</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040427020'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

I'm not surprised by Sid thoughts.<br>
As I said in a precedent post , I've tested one before a long time ago.<br>
it was only a 6P housing with an IR led head.<br>
the red glow was not covert but not really a &quot;bright spot&quot; too.<br>
Really, when I look at the SUREFIRE catalog, yes they have a few real pretty look items..only good enough for Hollywood movies with Schwarzenhendenbergendenberg and his fellow STALLONE the Italian Stallion.....<br>
once fitted on your favorite M4 with RIS, RAS, SIR or what ever you want, a PAQ-4 or PAQ-2, a TRIGICON, ACOQ or ML2 sight, an Eagle sling, one Pull mag to each magazine, ....... your M4 is amazing....maybe you forgot to fit your Microwave housing and stelite modulator and flat 150cm TV screen from Sony....<br>
you have spent billions of buck.....<br>
but once you are in the mud, dust and rain......<br>
<br>
what is the interest to have the super pretty look MXHZYW-ZZXR Super6 SUREFIRE?????<br>
<br>
the most important isn't to have a rugged workable unit, reliable in any situation at anytime????<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 20, 2002, 3:46 PM<BR> from IP address 81.48.38.122</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040428018'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>try and sight-in your NV weapons scope in the dark of night, try to find out if your shot is on the paper, etc.!!<br>
<br>
Most of the legitimate NV goggles do not have these holes, as there is no need to use them in the day (no sight-in procedure)<br>
<br>
The military weapons sights (i.e.PVS-4, PVS-502, etc.) have adjustable filtered &quot;holes&quot; that allow you to sight in the scope on your weapon during the day (so you can see what the hell you are doing and make adjustments!), and not overload your tube with excessive light conditions.<br>
<br>
The Russian scopes at the gun shows have holes in their caps so that you will buy them!  This way, the dealer can let you turn on the unit while indoors, and the image looks good, since even a pin hole will allow ALOT of light, enough to make the scope look good in the daytime light of a indoor gun show.  Problem is when you go out after dark and take the cover off, switch the unit on, you find out you can't see anything clearly!  Then you find out that the holes were actually &quot;holes&quot; in his sales pitch!  I have stood and listened to these &quot;reputable&quot; NV dealers at gun shows spew all kinds of &quot;info&quot; at unsuspecting buyers!<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>

			<P></center>PVS-7's and 14's all come with that little pinhole lens cover and they even call it a daylight filter(remember that rabid conversation some of us were involved in a while back about this?)   I am not sure of the purpose for these other than so you can make sure the goggle is working?  Maybe I should read the book.   I suppose they may do a certain amount of daylight training with them too,  so they are not falling all over each other at night the first time they use the goggle or monocular.  I still prefer a real filter that actually block all the white light and gives a nearly full field of view too.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 19, 2002, 7:12 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.231</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040353921'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>for whatever reason,  it is still far superior to the PVS-1, 2, and 3,  and other than the 4 being gen 2 about equal to that.    I actually have one that has a US label, and the AN/PVS-502 designation.   I don't know who used it, or where it came from,  I just have the body, but that seems to indicate that at least one was used by some aspect of our military.

AN/PVS-502 was issues, AND used by the Canadian Armed forces.  What part about the AN/PVS designation do you not understand?  I am sure that any owners of the 502 would be happy to send you a copy of their mil issue operator's manual (if I had mine still, I would send you a copy!).  In reality, the 502 was hands down the best Gen I scope ever produced.  And was surplused some years ago by the Canadian Armed Forces, and is still hanging around, albeit rarer than PVS-2's.<br>

You cannot purchase the full milspec tubes from ITT either so I have been told.  You can purchase mil-spec commercial tubes and yes that does seem contradictory, but it is more confusing than contradictory.

			<P></center>that is hype.  Anyone selling &quot;gen 4&quot; is doing it on their own terminology.  They may be selling filmless auto-gated image tubes and calling them gen 4, as they were referred to for a while,  but this was never officially specified as gen 4 by the military or anyone else. It does continue to linger on as reference to the unfilmed, auto-gated tubes though.  There is some noticeable difference in performance, however this may not be outweighed by the cost or possible decreasing performance of the tube over it's questionable lifespan.  These are all unconfirmed areas(other than the cost factor),  so for the average consumer to plunk down a couple thousand more above and beyond a really nice gen 3 would have to be a difficult personal choice. This is made even more difficult by the lack of information available on actual performance, tubelife expectations,  use in weapons systems potential failure questions,  manufacturer warranty questions, etc.  Seeems that everyone in the industry has differing answers to a lot of these questions.  The &quot;gen 4&quot; tubes stand above some of the others basically in high light performance, improved sig/noise, and improved photoresponse, perhaps overall gain. On the specs that were available earlier on,  they were not that much of an improvement over a real nice omni-5 tube.   I guess you would have to try and find someone who has purchased one from ATN in one of their devices and see what they think.  I have only seen one,  and it did work well in high light,  no distortion, very minimal halo, good resolution.  This was looking into a lighted house from outside at night.  Otherwise in regular dark conditions it was not a shocking improvement over a gen 3 omni-5.  Pinnacle or thin film auto gated tubes are very similar,  though hard to come by.   Halos on most of those were larger, at least on the ones I have tried, otherwise performance was very good.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 19, 2002, 6:50 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.166</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040309428'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Lanny summed it pretty well. I can add that as a Night Vision manufacturer I sometimes get acess to additional sources information. Accidentally, just today had a very good technical conversation with an extremely knowledgable person (won't mention names) who are building special surveying systems for the USA Army. After extensive trials of the so called 'Gen 4', they have decided not to use it. In addition to cost, questionable longetivity and other reasons mentioned above, he has added the following:<br>
a)Blooming (halo size) compared with European Gen 2+ or USA Gen 3 was much bigger.<br>
b) At certain time of the day around twilight, for about 30-45 minutes, the autogating system is starting 'conflicting' with the auto brightnes circuitry, creating absolutely unstable image.<br>
c) Higher power consumption.<br>

			<P></center>if it is an NQ/PVS-14 it is likely either an omni-3 or better commercial tube,  though it is hard to tell and it most likely did not come with any tube info.  The only way to tell would be to take the tube number to ITT and ask them, but they tire of that game rather quickly, ie, they don't really have the time or manpower to look up tube info for everyone who has an NQ/PVS-14.   If they did, they would send a sheet with every unit.  Depends on where it came from as to what might be in it.  If it does not have an ID label,  you should probably stop asking about it.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 19, 2002, 6:56 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.166</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040309773'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>for labels to be missing.  None of them really good reasons on a PVS-14. Some 7B's are built by individual companies that do not label them.   This is not usually the case with PVS-14's.   They are generally built by ITT, Litton, and NVEC or Excalibur(I am not sure they actually build them either), who all use labels.  I suppose the label could be worn or scratched accidently in some bizzare accident and just come off?   Probably not though.  The most obvious reason for it to be missing is for lack of identification.  Of course the image tube can be tracked too by the serial number. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 19, 2002, 11:08 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.205</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040324901'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

do you see any potential problems with using an adapter and aftermarket monocular?<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 18, 2002, 8:34 PM<BR> from IP address 12.164.4.105</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040272463'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

I was looking for a size like 30MM or something like that.(ITS ALL GREEK TO ME)  Either way Im sure the info you gave me is alot more detailed..Ill take that to a custom camera shop and see if they can make or get and adapter for that size...Appreciate it ...<br>

Do you think they would have something like that in an adapter or is that way too odd of a size?<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 19, 2002, 7:23 AM<BR> from IP address 12.164.4.94</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040311399'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I have a little 5mw laser module that I can see for over a mile.  If I had a target that was farther away,  it would probably be visible beyond that.   A 10mw laser is blinding to NV at close range(under 100yds).    You better hope you don't hit anything within 200yds that will reflect light(trees, rocks, cars, snow, houses, etc) or you will be damaging your NV.   At least that is from my experience with very low power IR lasers, and I am making the assumption that 150mw would be very bright compared to them.  If you plan to use it,  perhaps some sort of attenuation would be in order so you can control it somewhat.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 18, 2002, 7:55 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.157</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040270159'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>150 mw at 808nm will make a good medium range illuminator for gen 1, II, or III night vision gear. It's way brighter than you want or need as a pointer and if you collimate the beam it will not be eyesafe.  If you put an adjustable focus lens on it to give a useful diameter  (about 1 degree) it will provide useful illumination out to 500 yards with gen II and perhaps 1000 yards with Gen III. (you probably don't need it with genIII)  It will be roughly like using a 100 watt million candlepower spotlight naked eye.  It's bright enough that nearfield backscatter may require mounting the light source off to one side to get good contrast. <br>
<br>
At that power and wavelength the beam will be slightly visible looking at it even when it's defocused below injury levels.  Treat it like the beam is dangerous. It can be.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 18, 2002, 8:43 PM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040272993'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Look Terry I am avoiding the opportunity,  and will even go further in the spirit of Christmas, and say that he probably made a mistake in the listing and that is why he ended the auction before anyone could bid.    I did that one time,  somehow putting out a really nice gen 2 monocular for $200 with no reserve.  That would have been great had I not paid $400 for it!   Ebay insisted I had not put a reserve price on the original listing.  Oddly enough,  I got charged for the reserve fee?   Hey everybody makes mistakes,  even Terry sometimes.

			<P></center>that personaly I have never dealt with Terry and wasn't intending to accuse him of dealing in &quot;Borrowed&quot; stuff.  I figured it would probably be obvious that he didn't intend to list it for that price.  In fact, it probably wasn't even his mistake.  I got an email from the person who bid on it telling me that he did use the buy it now option and for some reason it didn't end the auction.  Ebay must have messed up somehow.

			<P></center>I am selling my TVS-5: The sight is in excellent condition, with flawless glass and a bright, very clear Gen. 2 tube. The total hours of use are unknown, but I myself have (at most) two hours on it.<br>
<br>
This sight is the crew-served (super-sized) version of the AN/PVS-4. The scope has a larger, 155mm objective, and 5.8x magnification. All other features are the same as the PVS-4.<br>
<br>
This sight would make a great NV surveillance scope, as it is rather large and heavy, but if you have a .50, or just want to put your AR's carry handle to the test, then a-weapon-mounting you will go.<br>
<br>
The scope comes with: 2 (two) Mil. 3V Lithium Batteries, Operator's Manual, Lens Tissue, G.I. Hard Transit Case, and several reticles, including: .50 cal M2HB / Mk19, 5.56 / M203, and Forward Observer (a cross-hair with hash marks). Other patterns / weapons can be found online... All placards are in place, and the interior of the case is in excellent condition.<br>
<br>
I'm asking $1500, shipped and insured, to anywhere in the Continental U.S. (NO EXPORT!). If you have any questions, please email: lynchdesign@hotmail.com. References available.<br>

			<P></center>super extravagant,  you can go with the PVS-15 from Litton.   It is available with flipup or fixed facemask type headmount,  same as the 7A, PVS-18, etc.  There is,  or I have seen some types of headmounts for the anvis,  though I have only seen 3 in my whole time of messing with NV.   There is a much less expensive and still very nice alternative in the D-321 binocular goggle which comes with a very nice flip up headstrap and costs about 1/2 of the other two options.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 18, 2002, 1:00 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.89</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040245259'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>The Fero 51 is a VERY nice set of binocs, with one of  the best IR filters and spotlight assemblies available today.<br>
<br>
Resolution is over 60lp/mm, so perfomance with the IR spotlight is very close to gen III (better than most Gen III 51lp/mm tubes), but you have to use the spotlight.  No bid deal, it mounts right above the binocular and is adjustable for windage and elevation.<br>
<br>
Optics are Zeiss, and world class.<br>
<br>
Cold War company in Colorado imported about 30 sets of the Jumelle 72, which was the Swiss Army version, VERY well made, complete, in a beautiful metal locking chest.<br>
<br>
They work very well, and will blow away any of the US Gen 0 stuff (M-18 binocs, etc.)<br>
<br>
Bulbs are very hard to find, except for Helmut-Singer, who has alot of them, around $18 each.  I have two sets of these binocs, and they are wonderful.<br>
<br>
Lanny can also comment on them.<br>
<br>
Acutally, if you took one of these binocs, with their wonderful Zeiss opitcs, and were able to retro-fit a Gen III tube, it would be the perfect binocular.  But the retro-fit would take some work, and there are tbe dimension differences.<br>
<br>
All-in-all, a VERY nice piece of night vision with stunning resolution (at 6x magnification, no less)<br>
<br>
And the IR filter/spotlight works awesome with other Gen II and Gen III devices!<br>
<br>

			<P></center>Finally a question I have some input on.  I'm usually just sucking everyone elses vast knowledge of night vision.  <br>
     I had a set of Goggles made be &quot;Night Owl&quot; that appear to be the same as those, they said ON 1x20 or something like that on the front.  What was said about the gain in the above post was correct.  When my eyes were not adjusted to the light, I could see about as well with the goggles as I would later be able to without them (after my eyes adjusted).  I had quite a bit of fun with them, as they were the ones that got me started in night vision, but they were pretty dependant on the IR illuminator, which was pretty strong, by the way.  The red dot on the front was also quite visable for quite far away.  Did I ever attempt to drive with them? ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Depth perception was pretty decent on the set I had, but resolution wasn't very good, except in the very center of the field of view, and the field of view seems pretty small.  I don't know how they compare to PVS-5's since I have never had a set, but I would suspect, the aren't even on the same page.  Hope this helps.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 17, 2002, 2:39 PM<BR> from IP address 172.149.124.156</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040164759'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I don't know if anyone here makes them, but I believe the US type of gen 1 tube is still manufactured.  They work much better for several reasons,  of course they were mostly 3 stage being the obvious one.  Even 30 year old 3 stage gen 1 high quality intensifiers are an improvement over any of the Russian gen 1 that I have seen.   The US type tubes used a fiber optic input and output windows that were curved on the inside so as to minimize peripheral distortion inherent in electrost inversion focused tubes of that type.  They had a much more precise method of focus also.  They were also not as fragile as the little glass tubes with the &quot;pod&quot; inside on a glass pedestal.  Perhaps some of the Russian devices in gen 1 utilize this type of tube now,  but I have not seen one.  Of course with the 3 stage US units,  overall performance is greatly improved, and by using that method, noise is minimized by controlling the light the gain gradually rather than trying to get it all out of one tube.  At least that is my understanding of it all.   I suppose I could be completey wrong though?<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 19, 2002, 7:11 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.166</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1040310666'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I do not know if Russians ever had a volume production of 3 stage Gen 1 unit. But the double stage design was very popular, and in volume production until end of 90s. Besides many purely military models, those were used on the following models: Baigish 5P, NZT 3B, NP 2, T3H and maybe few more. Easy to identify due to long size of the tube, and consequently - the product.<br>
<br>
Luck of orders from the Russian military, and cheaper US 'surplus' Gen 2 tubes have killed this product eventually.<br>

			<P></center>Ah, but you did not read all the text Sid !<br>
<br>
The guy says in the ad that you &quot;use two American AA batteries&quot; - maybe thats where the extra performance comes from - the batteries are not just duracell, but uranium powered!<br>
<br>
Seriously, a solid enough unit with good performance - when compared with other Gen 1 devices; certainly not even close to Gen 2 (except with loads of IR, and at close ranges.<br>
<br>
Trading one of these might get you the soft carry case for the 7-Bs, but thats about all !<br>

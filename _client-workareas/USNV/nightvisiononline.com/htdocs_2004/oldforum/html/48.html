this is the web page for details of the MX10130 tube, but that P/N looks like an EXCALIBER unit. Rich? <br>
<br>
<br>
from your resolution number, i would guess OMNI III as you can not achieve 64 lp/mm of the OMNI 4 and 5 tubes without the 6 microplate.<br>

<br>
I think there are better day/night scope solutions using something in a Night Force, or better yet a US Optics 1.5-10x55mm scope. Then use something like a PVS-14 or 6015 and the Monoloc rig for hooking the NV to the scope.<br>

The ATN rig offers a pretty good value if they have given you a good tube. Please keep us posted regarding their repair attempt.<br>

I used to have a set of (2nd gen)7b's and I have got to say that I like the 7A alot better than the 7b.<br>
<br>
They are smaller for one, have the cool automatic on/off feature with the flip-up facemask, the facemask HAS a flip-up feature, the facemask is orders of magnitude better than the one for the 7b in comfort, stability and construction, (no sag like the 7b, or wobble ) and the optics to my eye are much clearer, although that may just be the difference in tube resoultion and I'm errantly chalking it up to the optics. (Sorry for the run-on sentence.)<br>
<br>
Seriously, these goggles seem to be priced similarly to the 7b, so a difference in price can't be the factor driving the popularity of the 7b's over the 7a.<br>

			<P></center>I know of some other guys, including me that think the same way.  I believe the 7B/D is cheaper to make, cheaper to maintain,  and easier to use for the average schmo.  You may notice that with the larger oculars/longer eye relief, it is a bit harder to find that sweet spot where you can actually see through both lenses?   It takes a bit of practice and use to get used to that,  and the B you can sorta throw on your face and see through them.  The A has superb optics however, and much nicer objective focus.  I really think it was a matter of cost of mass production. <br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>7A-7B</b><br>by PAUL<P></center>No it wasn't cost or mass production....when the shoot off with the Army took place the 7A's were CHEAPLY made.. during the shoot off a few of the lenses actually broke off of the goggle. They simply did not meet the req'mts of the USARMY at that time. The troups who did the testing did not like the feel of the goggles pressing on their face for up to 6 hours at a time. The pads were hard for some to adjust (espically the women). There was no peripheral vision (being able to look under the goggle while wearing them)they did not like the hair net mounting and many other things.Keep in mind a group of approx 50 (some men/some women) basically made this choice. When testing with women on the 7B's I had some with so small a head that the goggle would just spin around on their head no matter how we tried to adjust them. Also I believe that Varo reacted faster to the Army concerns, the head band for instance was totally redesigned in the period between the Ft Benning phase and the cold weather phase in Alaska of the shoot off.There are many more stories but I believe these were the most pressing.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 12, 2001, 5:41 AM<BR> from IP address 38.209.89.95</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008164474'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>7A-7B</b><br>by PAUL<P></center>Well of course they do all the tech testing, which both goggles faired about the same, since the gvt'm set the spec.<br>
The field testing consisted of a shoot off at Ft Benning where a group of soldiers ran around for about three days trying to destroy the goggles. They wore them out on various field test,(field of view-ease of adjustments-comfort-fit-etc)of course night marches and a lot of classroom stuff.<br>
They then gave thier comments. Both companies had problems at this point.At that time we went back to Garland and redesigned the head band from the comments we received.<br>
About a month or so later we received word that we would go into phase two (cold weather testing) and that Litton would not be there for this phase, although I believe still in the running.<br>
Cold weather testing was done in the fall/winter of 87 at Ft Greely, Alaska, about 200 miles from Fairbanks.<br>
I did the training for Varo in Alaska, I did not do the training at Ft Benning.<br>
Cold weather training consisted of about fourty hours of classroom training where the troups learned how to properly wear and use the goggle the goggle. The training was taken right from the military version of the maintenance manual.<br>
The second part of the training was at night, of course, and we spent three weeks of many long cold nights testing. Again we did FOV,interpupilualry adj proper selection of brow pad for comfort fit on long marches etc.<br>
This was about a week, then after that it was mostly night to sun-up marches, some as long as 20 miles. I must admit I did not always march with them, at times I would get into the ambulance and ride for an hour or two, hey I wasnt in the service any more.<br>
I believe there were 30 soldiers in the group to start with, about 5 were female. You dont want to know how many of the females actually finished the course.<br>
I did further testing with &quot;certian other groups&quot; in the states and several foriegn countries and also some civillian swat groups in the U.S..<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 12, 2001, 11:30 AM<BR> from IP address 38.209.89.95</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008185412'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Now that is a much more detailed history than the one I was given before,  basically that they were cost cutting?  Anyway,  sounds like you have had some experiences!   I don't understand how they could have less peripheral with the 7A's though. They actually have  a slightly longer eye relief, and with no cups,  you can see under them quite well I thought?   They must have improved them since then?  I don't think I could break the lens of with a hammer!  How the heck did they manage that?  Of course that was in the early days of military quotas and reduced requirements on mental and physical capabilities also wasn't it?<br>
Thanks Paul for the info.  I was told that the 7A uses the same objective cell as the anvis, is that true?<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 12, 2001, 7:19 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.52</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008213564'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>7A-7B</b><br>by paul<P></center>Not sure but I think you are right about the 7A objective and ANVIS. The early 7A's, at least the ones we &quot;obtained&quot; to check out how they wre built and how they acomplished certian things, all had plastic objectives and right where they met the body they got rather smaller than the objective body itself and this is the point where they broke. Also the red light indicators in the eyepieces to show low battery and IR on in the 7A's was a piece of edge light plastic protruding somewhat down onto the field of view. This was not to impressive with the Army or the troups using it. My approch (I have a patent)was to drill a small (.010. dia hole) in the turning mirrors them self and put a red led behind the mirror. When activated it shines thru the hole and appears to be about .125 in dia due to the 10/1 eyepiece. By the way that is why it is critical that you are familar with the correct procedure to remove the rear cover, or you could damage the felx circuit, and of course scratch the optics.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 13, 2001, 11:13 AM<BR> from IP address 38.209.89.95</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008270780'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>If I have a need to remove the rear cover,  they will be going to someone who knows a lot more than me about them,  that is for sure.  Hopefully I would not have to ever experience that.  The objective is now a larger diameter where it mounts to the body,  and it mounts with a metal ring nut.  I think the lens assembly might be metal as well. Not sure, I guess I should go look.<br>

I have first hand experience in the comparison of a 25mm F1.4 and 25mm F 0.95, and a 75mm F1.8 and 75mm F1.3.  In both cases, the faster lens provided greater light gathering capability, that was most obvious in very dark situations.<br>
<br>
However, another thing I noticed... the faster lenses also provided a better image when stopped down to match the slower lenses. It is probably a function of less light being reflected off of the lens body walls, when the aperture is closed 1 click.<br>
<br>
You may notice a little less gain going from an F1.2, but I;m sure you would see a difference.<br>

			<P></center>Given that both lenses are of high quality and produce good images the f/0.95 lens will put (1.2/.95)^2 or slightly over 50% more light on the tubes cathode while giving the same image scale and field of view.  The faster lens will give a noticable though not dramatic improvement in brightness.  There is no free lunch.  The faster lens will cost more, be larger and heavier, and give a little less depth of field though that's only a problem at short distances.  You have to decide if the tradeoff is what you want.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 12, 2001, 9:02 AM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008176563'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

i can see why you might have problems w/ light gain and resolution though, going through another scope will cut down the light , not to mention the conditions.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 11, 2001, 2:41 PM<BR> from IP address 158.252.130.230</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008110517'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<br>
This configuration will work if the PVS-14 is mounted FORWARD of the ACOG (typically on an RAS or similar). As you pointed out, resolution will shift based on the ACOG's magnification. <br>
<br>
There is a lot of specialized glass between the incoming image and your eye, this causes the POI / POA shift... Reed Knight has spent a lot of money to try and correct this problem with his &quot;Knight Scope&quot; night vision device (usually seen in front of the Leupold scope on the Mk11 Mod0 SWS, it is still in development).<br>

It's too early to say if the system will work.  The gun was shooting high but the groups were relatively tight.  More experimentation is definitely in order.<br>
<br>
The optics together aren't producing a blurry image.  Definitely no complaints, there.  It's not a Raptor but perhaps it has the potential to be the next best thing; at least that's my hope.<br>

			<P></center>I tried the M983 with a couple of other optics, looking through binoculars and also through a rifle scope. Both worked well,  but I noticed that I had to be careful to focus the objective of the monocular to the reticle of the rifle scope or I got some blurryness.  Perhaps a bit of fine focusing into the ACOG would clear it up.  Might be a fine line as the close proximity focus of the 7's is very fine, I think.  I may try it with the A's later.  If I was not selling the 983 I would make an adapter and put it on the rifle scope. Seemed to work out real nice.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 12, 2001, 7:23 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.52</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008213808'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Jay,  I use a simple leupold 100 yard target, I think it is a sighting target.  It has 4 2&quot; black squares on the corners of a white center square.  It was easily visible on a moonless night @ 100 yards with the 441 gen 3.  <br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>well...</b><br>by Takatuka san<P></center>We all know that Generation 1 devices are not very sensitive to light... At least they are not as sensitive as generation 2 or 3 devices. Does that mean that a generation 3 device is more vulnerable to light? I have never used a generation 2 or 3 device but if they have such a phenomemal light gain then they would easily die if you<br>
would activate it in moon light conditions (sometimes i am afraid to use my generation 1 device at moonlight because the image becomes so bright you just start to see blackspots) I wonder what kind of an<br>
image you get with your generation 3 devices at moonlight conditions.<br>
Isnt it too bright?<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Gen 3 and bright light</b><br>by Jared<P></center>Generation three devices are very well protected agianst bright light with the help of Automatic Brightness Control which automaically sets the tube power to the amount of light.This perevents &quot;blooming&quot; when going from a dark area to a bright source of light. As for moonlight conditions the image only gets clearer, but that also depends on the atmosperic conditions on that perticualar night. You have to also understand that a lot of the gen 3 devices on the market were design for the military, and must be able to handle demanding situations, gunfire, explosions, and adverse conditions.

			<P></center>Can anybody tell me if it is possible to ascertain the date of manufacture for ITT commercial NV equipment?  Specifically, I have a NQ-160 of which I'd like to figure out it's date of origin.  In reading an earlier post on this forum, it seems that ITT is no longer making a 45 lp/mm tube in favor of 51 lp/mm.  Supposedly, that cut off date was last March. Assuming this info was correct, I would like to know what I am working with.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance to anyone who may be able to answer this question.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 10, 2001, 4:03 PM<BR> from IP address 162.83.204.151</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008029002'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>160 45/51  ID</b><br>by Biggame223<P></center>I THINK that an easy way to tell is that on the newer 51 lp unit you can ONLY adjust the objective focus and NOT the one near your eye.<br>

			<P></center>on how much money you want to spend. for distances of 100 yards i think the gen 2 scopes work really well. i had a USNV Cobra gen2 scope and it worked great for that kind of stuff. it need IR assist if the moon was not out but when i hit the IR to ON it really lite up out to 100 yards. always had good luck retaining zero on the flat top AR too. when there was lots of moon light the gen2 cobra really was alot of bang for your buck.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Untitled</b><br>by code-1<P></center>I would have to agree with mr h. The cobra would work nicely for around 1000 dollars. A gen 3 scope such as the 441 or 343 would give you more performance at low light but will cost around 2500. I shot a cobra most of last fall and it did real great for the money. If there was any moon you did not need the IR Illum. For a star light or cloudy night the IR really brighted up the image to about a 100 to 150 yards.It really all comes down to what you want to spend.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 10, 2001, 3:56 PM<BR> from IP address 24.116.29.56</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008028570'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I agree with mrH and Code1, that it all depends on your budget.  If you are looking to spend less than 1000 bucks,  well you will have to go used, or gen 1 with a good illuminator.  For just over 1K there are some nice gen 2's with illuminator,  Cobra is a nice compact choice there.  It has a nice built in illuminator and at 100 yards, would be good for most circumstances.  Gen 3 would of course be the best choice,  but there you are looking at over 2K for anything decent, unless you can find a good used device, which in gen 3 is probably not likely, unless someone is moving up the scale of gen 3's and is wanting to sell off their  previous gen 3 purchase.  I had a 241(Cobra) and it was pretty nice,  worked well, and the new owner is apparently quite satisfied with it as well.  I guess what we are all trying to say is, you can shoot foxes with about anything,  but you can shoot more of them, under darker conditions and at longer ranges depending on how much you want to invest.  You could start at about $500 or so, right on up to more than you think is possible.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 10, 2001, 7:02 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.102</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008039725'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Nothing in the Gen I compares to the PVS-502 for clarity, brightness AND most importantly...usable reticle, in my humble opinion.  I have owned numerous Russian NV scopes, and a US AN.PVS-2.  No comparison. <br>
<br>
Since you are hunting foxes, i will assume that you are an avid shooter, like me.<br>
<br>
When using a NV scope, it REALLY pays to have a lit reticle, and a reticle that is completely adjustable for brightness.  Let me explain.  Let's say that you are socuting for foxes.  yo leave the reticle turned off on the PVS-502, and use it just like a monocular (a VERY clear monocular!).  You then spot a fox walking at around 100 yards.  You then take your support hand and gently turn the rheostat up, and the reticle magically appears in your scope.  I like to turn the reticle up and down slowly, at the same time I am breathing, which gives a nice, unobstructed view of the target (fox).  As you slowly squeeze the trigger, you increase the brightness of the reticle just enough to super-impose it over the fox.  BAM! Dead fox. Try to shoot the same thing with the PVS-2, and you will really see the difference! I find that shooting with the reticle just barely on, and adjusting my rheostat as I breath, makes for the most accurate shot I can get.  this is just my technique, so it might be different for you.<br>
But i have found that I never need to adjust the brightness of my reticle over about 1/3 of the low range (it is REALLY bright if yo turn it up!).  This allows me to see my target clearly, at the same time i can see my reticle clearly as well, and the brightness of the reticle doesn't interfere with my view of the vitals of the target.  i can shoot using this natural (for me) technique, groups of around 1 1/4&quot; to around 2 3/8&quot; all day long, night after night.  My average group size this summer, on a partly cloudy night with 1/4 moon and a few stars was around 1 5/8&quot; overall.  So I could reliably hit a cotton tail rabit sized target at 100 yards every time.  However, I also don't shoot offhand with the scope.  I utilize some sort of rest everytime.  whether this is a cement shooting bench, the hood of my pickup, or a partially rolled up window (with my jacket as a pad).  hey, you might as well capitalize on anything you can find to steady your gun!  After a while, it is pretty natural. I have also shot the PVS-502 at 200 and three hundred yards on full moon night, with groups averaging around 3 1/4&quot; to 4&quot; at 200 yards (12&quot; target) and around 6-7&quot; at 300 yards (12 inch target).  I had absolutely no problem seeing the target at all, as a matter of fact, it was more fun to shoot at cans set up at 300 yards than it was to shoot at 100 yards.  Since there is no  recoil on my Bushmaster V-Match .223 (it weighs 13lb), I could see the cans fall one by one!<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is just my $.02 worth, and I am not an expert marksman by any means.  But I do practice with my PVS-502 and AR15 alot, just as I do with my daytime setup (Tikka 595 sporter, .223, with Tasco Super Sniper 10x42).  Practice makes you shoot better, get your breathing down, etc., and practice at night REALLY makes you improve.  I practice reloading my magazines at night, as well, but I always have my rifle pointed downrange, just like the daytime.  i try to do everything in the dark, just as you would if you had to do it in real life, it makes you much more proficient with both your NV scope, and your rifle.  But remember to practice safe range rules and gun safety!!  Before putting you weapon away, turn some lights on and make sure your gun is unloaded and your chamber is clear!!  No excuses for proper gun safety.<br>
<br>
Feel free to email me and I will send you some pics of the target that works the best for me (it is a very simple target, nothing fancy, but with good contrast - that's the key to shooting at night with a Gen I scope!).  I can also send you some pictures of the groups I have shot with my PVS-502 at 100 yards (I save every one!)  This should give yo an idea of what the PVS-502 is capable of in the hands of an average shooter like myself.  If this sounds like a plug for the PVS-502...it is!!!  I love this scope so much it makes me cry with joy every time I take her out of her military case!!!<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 11, 2001, 7:25 PM<BR> from IP address 64.12.103.53</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008127551'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

ITT and Litton both make &quot;THE&quot; AN/PVS-14 monocular for the military,  ITT makes a couple of variants for the commercial market that don't have all the components of the military version.  As far as I know Litton makes only the military version,  which is sometimes available for commercial sale.  I have heard that ITT's military PVS-14 is sometimes available also. Otherwise,  you can get the commercial units, which if properly selected can be very nice, nothing at all wrong with them.

			<P></center>Litton manufactures two versions of the PVS-14D (both are &quot;MILSPEC&quot;: &quot;Objective&quot; and &quot;Threshold&quot; spec) again refer to the actual inspectors &quot;findings&quot;.<br>
<br>
ITT also manufactures the PVS-14D, and also makes Excalibur label &quot;EX-PVS-14D&quot; (the &quot;EX&quot; stands for Excalibur)<br>
Once again, compare the inspectors findings...<br>
<br>
The differences between ITT and Litton made PVS-14D are academic.  Both are excellent quality. <br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Lifetime of PVS-7 intensifier tubes???</b><br>by Doc<P></center>Does anyone know what the average lifetime is of a PVS-7B type of tube with the following conditions.<br>
<br>
1)  I store the unit at 70 to 75 F in a dry environment.<br>
2)  The unit gets a fresh nitrogen purge every 6 months.<br>
3)  I take the unit out at least once per month and run it for 15 minutes or so.<br>
4)  The unit is never exposed to high temperature or adverse conditions.<br>
5)  I actually use the system for several hours at a time about 3 or 4 times per year.<br>
<br>
I know that the Gen 3 tubes last for 10,000 hours or so of running time, but what about their shelf life?  Is it 10 years, 15 years?<br>
<br>
I would love somebody with true knowledge of this querry to let me know.<br>

PS I found a guy selling Aim SHOT lasers that come fitted with 625nm range diodes, but he has 850nm diodes available. Complete with AR-15 barrel mounting kit, roughly $200.  I think you have to buy the stock laser, and work out a way to buy the 850nm diode seperately. I'll send ya his info via email if you're interested.<br>

Even though both units are rated w/ the same FOV,  there is a HUGE differance IMO when looking thru both eyes as opposed to one. <br>

I cannot do that with my 160<br>

My 160 unit is super nice for what it is intended,  but the 7Bs are what I need.<br>
<br>
Amazingly enough I am almost giving away the 160 unit and no one wants to buy (must be due to Xmas, and layoffs??)<br>

Thanks<br>

			<P></center>VARO was bought by Litton a number of years ago.  They were in Garland Texas.  Litton (Which was bought by Northrop Grumman, so technically there isn't a Litton anymore either!) has one of their night vision production facilities there.<br>
<br>
I am very curious, what &quot;Night Vision Dealer&quot; was at the Harrisburg gun show and would suggest that an alternative for you would be the VARO tubes?<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 8, 2001, 1:36 PM<BR> from IP address 204.186.177.197</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007847398'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

There were only two night vision presenters at the show, these guys and a group called DRB Enterprises who were promoting the ATN line of day/night products.<br>
<br>
Prestige mostly had 7s and American Eagle monoculars.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>... bleak indeed ...</b><br>by RJ<P></center>I have experienced worse, but it was pretty bleak with only &quot;two&quot; official NV presenters and a handfull of pocket scopes floating around at other tables.<br>
<br>
One table was all ATN day scopes and various NV rigs. Although they did not have one of the Gen3+M Mil-Spec Patriot or Day/Night scope systems. As an aside, ATN does not say what &quot;mil spec&quot; they mean in any of their source info, other than it being a 64lp tube.<br>
<br>
The other main presenter was the guy mentioned below. He had (4) PVS-7 rigs, listed only as Gen III and a handfull of American Eagle pocket scopes listed as Gen III.<br>
<br>
Most of the other NV devices floating around were ITT 150 pocket scopes or other Gen 1 &amp; II items.<br>
<br>
Both booths had plenty of folks eyeballing the NV gear. You would probably do well to work some shows into your schedule, with a little more inventory on hand.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's me, but I am become very hard to impress at these shows lately.  Now that I own a 50 BMG, I don't even really get that excited those nice rifles.  My brother commented today, they needed to have an attraction set up for &quot;bear wrestling&quot;.<br>
<br>

			<P></center>Maybe when and if I get set up for some shows, I should bring along some NV goggle clad, mud wrestling females? I can put them in a small unlit tent and then you can try out the NV while watching the wrestling.  Perhaps that would be a bit too much?<br>

You must have some PT Barnum in your blood.  <br>
<br>
If you went this route, you may not be able to bring along enough inventory and would sell out the first day.  The question is, would you hang around the second day, still offering the NV mud wrestling, if you had sold out of product? <br>
<br>
Let me know if you need any booth volunteers.  I know it's tough work, but somebody's got to do it.<br>

PS... but seriously, having a very dark tent is a great idea. I recall someone doing this at a show one year, when they were going strong in Valley Forge.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 9, 2001, 11:19 AM<BR> from IP address 24.4.252.7</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007925556'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Beware!</b><br>by clynch<P></center>FYI:<br>
<br>
Keith Oliver used to run a night vision company out of Georgia called Hi-Tech Optics. <br>
<br>
About three years ago, he was at a gun show, and a friend and I had a look at his stuff. Everything looked great in the show hall, with the filter on, etc. Said friend laid down $2800 on a set of PVS-7's with (and I quote:) &quot;64 lp/mm, Mil-Spec tube, the best, brand new&quot;, etc. Too good to be true? We'll see...<br>
<br>
We took the unit out that night, to a rural location to have a look around, and compare it with my 45 lp/mm 7B's. The tube in his &quot;prime&quot; unit was snowing bright yellow (blizzard is more like it), and we never could get it to fully focus, or stop blooming. &quot;High resolution&quot;, it was not. It was bad.<br>
<br>
The only good things to come out of this event:<br>
My friend took the unit back and got a full refund;<br>
My friend kept the 3x lens that he bought with it (got a great deal for buying it with the goggle)<br>
<br>
I have heard other similar stories about this person's and company's blatent mis-representation of tube performance levels, and NV gear in general (heard, not witnessed, but having the above happen solidifies it enough for me).<br>
<br>
People change, and perhaps he has become more educated on the subject, but use caution just the same.<br>
<br>

			<P></center>They were bought out in the mid 80's I believe, maybe earlier.  They made a lot of gen 1 stuff, and some gen 2, I think.  I doubt if you would find any Varo tubes for replacement of anything current.  PVS-502, PVS-2, some of the weapons driving and sighting devices.

			<P></center>No, Lanny, Varo was bought by Litton in the 1990's.  They made excellent Gen II and 36 lp Gen III tubes. (In the 1960's they made Gen I and in the 1950's made Gen 0)<br>
<br>
They also made (assembled) the Aquila series weaponsight as well as the 7B, PVS-5 series, and a great many of the PVS-4's and PVS-2's.  <br>
<br>
Most Varo employees ended up working for Litton.<br>
Forget about finding any &quot;new&quot; VARO tubes, though you could still find some old tubes that would still be excellent replacement tubes.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 8, 2001, 8:10 PM<BR> from IP address 204.186.177.197</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007871059'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>just curious...</b><br>by RJ<P></center> Why would there be old Varo tubes still floating around?<br>
<br>
If they were good quality t seems they would have found homes long ago. Is it a case where they had been forgotten and recently discovered collecting dust, but never sold or put into service and traded in toward newer tubes?<br>
<br>
Did Varo produce anything of similar quality to Litton's more recent vintage Omni IV ANVIS tubes?<br>

			<P></center>some stuff goes here and there and ends up on a shelf, in a box, or at an auction.   The ones I heard about, I chased down when looking for parts for a PVS-502 weapon sight.   They said they were purchased from a stock lot that was discontinued or something,  probably when Litton/Varo dropped all those old devices from production.  Once the military sacked the sights, there was no need for the parts.  I think the good Dr. told me they use them in special photography applications because of the high resolution or something.   Like I said the ones I saw were superb as far as performance goes.  The gen 1 PVS-502 was a better scope than the gen 2 PVS-4 in some ways.  <br>
The Varo gen 2 and 3 stuff used to pop up on ebay quite often a year or so ago.  Some big 40mm tubes also.  I have seen some gen 0 on there not too long ago also.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 9, 2001, 10:45 AM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.102</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007923548'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<br>
I would say the price, but it really seems too good and I hate to lower the cost threshold on these babies without good merit.<br>
<br>
The tube would be from a Litton distributor and does not appear to be stolen, a &quot;fallout&quot; tube or surplus.<br>

			<P></center>I understand that Nightline is currently the only Litton &quot;distibutor&quot;  though there are other &quot;dealers&quot; <br>
If they will sell you  the tube and it is an OMNI 4 with documentation,  it cannot be a fallout tube,  if it is new.  It ought to be a very nice tube, if you can justify the cost, why not?<br>

			<P></center>Nightline is indeed the only Litton distributor for the United States. If the price is to good to be true I would ask to see the documentation prior to purchase. The Litton tube sheet can be faxed and then authenticated, I would be happy to help with this process as well.<br>
<br>
I do not know of to many OMNI 4 tubes sitting around, especially since we are on OMNI 5. Take it slow and make sure you are getting what you pay for.<br>

			<P></center>I would like to say that there are many credible source for Litton equipment out there. As always if you feel confident that a company is representing the product then go for it. Traditionally, distributors sell to dealers who then sell to the end user. There are many companies who credibly sell Litton products as well as products from other night vision manufacturers. These companies are the front line in getting night vision to the end user. One does not have to buy from the manufacturer or distributor to get a good price and great service on a piece of night vision. <br>

			<br>Forum Owner<P></center>It seems that recent postings about IR lasers have gotten out of hand. I have noticed a certain individual who has been rather vocal and seems to not want to give an email and has posted under different names. <br>
<br>
The IR laser issue is just that, an issue. I do not think that what has been said has been in violation of the rights of the citizens of this fine country. If you want a laser, build one, you will not get it from the manufacturer. This is just something that an individual must deal with, plain and simple. <br>
<br>
Attacking people who post what they have found out is very childish and it needs to stop. If it does not stop I will take care of it.<br>
<br>
Remember I pay for this board out of my pocket, if you want an arguement board, buy one, but do not do it here. I appreciate all who post here in an appropriate manner.<br>

I apprecaite your prompt response and look forward to night vision related post in the future.<br>
<br>
I would also like to stand up for Lanny as I think he was caught in a cross fire that was undeserved. Lanny is an honest person and was simply trying to relay information. For what it is worth I believe that he deserves an apology as he is a great asset to this industry and this board. <br>

			<P></center>If I knew him , it might be possible. <br>
<br>
But I don't know him , or how he really is , all I can do is read an individuals words.<br>
<br>
   And his (whether misinterpreted or not) clear , sheer and utter arrogance that shone through by telling people &quot;they might as well just quit&quot; trying to obtain a legal item , as if &quot;he&quot; is the IR/LAM &quot;gatekeeper&quot;.<br>
<br>
    I did give him credit later by him later saying:<br>
<br>
  &quot;They're supposed to be LEO  but hey , do what you want&quot; he done it just right , which my typing finger surely wished he would have done.<br>
<br>
   If his INITIAL post didn't come one so strong telling people who are trying to aquire one that they might as well give up , I would've never had any ammunition.<br>
<br>
   There is a certain finess to posting on mesage boards and getting your message across without grinding mud in the face of an obvious amount of people who are going to take exception to what you're about to hit the button on.<br>
<br>
   I don't claim to be the best at it , but he really needs to work on it. Whatever apology can be extracted from that , he's welcome to. <br>
  <br>
<br>
    He may be a fine individual. <br>
<br>
BUT. <br>
<br>
    He needs to realize that people absolutely abhor and will vehemently reject with extreme prejudice being told &quot;they can't&quot;.<br>
<br>
     It just ain't American.<br>
<br>
(ps: all the inflamed posters weren't me)<br>

			<P></center>I don't want to start this up again,  but I never said &quot;quit trying to obtain&quot;,just &quot;quit asking&quot; and  I was speaking directly to some guys who had been asking me about getting them for them, and also to some others on the forum, not to the whole world in general,  perhaps I should have been more clear there.  You are certainly free to obtain whatever device you can get someone to sell you,legal or illegal.  I was simply trying to relate the reasons, as I understood them, of why we are not supposed to sell them.  I never said they made much sense, other than perhaps the manufacturer's fear of lawsuits, which is not really  unfounded in this social climate, and considering that they are dangerous, in careless hands.   I am not looking for apologies, maybe some common decency and a little self restraint from some? Maybe that is a bit much to expect.  We certainly should be able to share ideas, even opinions without all the name calling and insults, especially without looking for clarification to make sure we really understand each other.  Seems like there is a lot of mis-reading of the written word these days,  or reading into.  I have noticed that a lot on these forums. Anyway, maybe this will help you know me a little better.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 10, 2001, 7:21 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.102</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008040881'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

When there's a silent ban on the price of something it always means that the dealers are coordinated to rip people for as much as possible. Several different industries are like this. It does not instill trust or confidence at all. <br>

I don't think I would be out of line by saying that the retail price for an M-983 (set by Litton) to be around $5200 and the M-983-000 to be around $5700.<br>
<br>
Again, It is very unlikely that someone has these in stock.  Delivery time (with deposit) is about 180 days.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2001, 1:08 PM<BR> from IP address 208.51.129.73</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007759336'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>A discussion board where prices are not allowed to be discussed or advertised ?  <br>
<br>
BWAHAHAHAHA !!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Thats a joke right ?<br>
<br>
Hmm , what could be the only reason in the world for this ? (as Churchlady would say)<br>
<br>
Doesn't that set off any bells with any of you all ?<br>
<br>
    Obviously it says: &quot;hey , we don't want anyone going between dealers , relating their deals and prices here to get the best deal possible and we stive to collude &amp; keep everyone in the dark on anything but blue-sky retail as to keep our profit per unit maxed out&quot;.<br>
<br>
      Doesn't anyone see that the dealers can just sit here and hype their own merchandise &amp; run down others and cause you to want to call them on the phone to pay 5% under full-boat retail and think you got a deal because prices aren't minimized by free market competition ?  <br>
 <br>
     Surely everyone sees the same people answering all questions and recommending certain things.     <br>
     <br>
        The the water is further clouded by premiums for &quot;grades &amp; spots&quot; in the same model unit.<br>
<br>
    In the real world this is subject to RICO laws and price fixing. <br>
<br>
      Not accusing you Rich of collusion , but are you a dealer ? (correct me if I'm wrong) If in fact you are , it certainly benefits all dealers then doesn't it ?  <br>
<br>
     Guess everyone has learned to look at retail and take 40% off to be in the ballpark and realize what you should be paying ,then start from there.<br>
<br>
     I'm now thinking I should become a dealer. If ya can't beat 'em join 'em. Or at least start an open discussion forum where we can pencil people/dealers down and help everyone get the best deal. <br>
<br>
    &quot;don't talk prices next thing you know people will be getting deals&quot;.<br>
  <br>
    I guess in all fairness, it is a dealer owned board , so it's a dictatorship.<br>
<br>
    So I digress....guess this is just what a newcomer sees and the regulars have accepted as surfs &amp; subjects.<br>
<br>
    I expect this message will be nuked quickly.<br>

<br>
You seem to be quite well spoken and I feel that I must justify my rules. This board is intended for information, not advertisements. I do allow individuals to post items for sale but EBAY is a great medium for sales as well. I have asked that pricing not be an issue and to focus on the technology. I certainely do not mind Rich posting retail prices.<br>
<br>
No one is hiding prices and I was taken aback by your previous post. The people and companies that respond on this board have many years of industry experience in this field. Use us as a tool and I can assure you that the postings on the board are honest because I police it. Please realize that your reference of ripping people off was wholly uncalled for.<br>
<br>
Real simple, If you don't like the board - don't use it.<br>
<br>

			<P></center>I didn't say or even reference that anyone was &quot;ripping&quot; people off.<br>
<br>
It's all in who the reader of the post is.<br>
<br>
First : A person isn't being &quot;ripped off&quot; if they are paying manufacturers suggested retail.<br>
<br>
Second : If no one (and I don't believe they have or are ,or even mean to imply) is charging &quot;over&quot; retail , then &quot;ripping off&quot; is a physical impossibility.<br>
<br>
So let it not be said that I implied such.<br>
<br>
I simply think it's pretty obvious that there's no prestige in paying retail and is this day and age it's a sure bet that the minute a price is made public , someone will be there momentarily to cut their throat. If their throat is not exposed , it can not be cut.<br>
<br>
That's all.<br>
<br>
I didn't come to post prices anyway , I just found it odd that since I landed here I never seen a price anywhere and it finally dawned on me when Rich skipped my pricing question. <br>
<br>
Thank you for the forum and I'll respect your rule.<br>

			<P></center>Yes, I guess you could say I am a &quot;Dealer&quot; actually I am the Director of Operations for Excalibur Electro Optics.  http://www.nightvis.com<br>
We manufacture night vision devices and are also the Commercial Distributor for ITT Night Vision and the &quot;factory outlet&quot; for NVEC, Inc. (Night Vision Equipment Co.)<br>
<br>
I have worked for this company for 12 years.<br>
Our parent company is a major night vision contractor for the US Govt and OEM for Litton Night Vision.<br>
<br>
We (Excalibur) supply many other night vision companies and &quot;dealers&quot; with night vision devices and parts.  We also have a major hand in repair of night vision devices.<br>
<br>
In addition, we are also competitors in sales for a number of night vision dealers you might see on this board.<br>
<br>
So, why am I on this board?<br>
Because I really believe that an informed consumer is good for the industry to weed out the scam artists.  In addition, I really enjoy night vision devices and interacting with those who have similar interests.  <br>
<br>
As freely as I give information and advise about night vision, just as freely am I critical in hunting down and bringing to light the rip-off artists who present themselves as legitimate dealers. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2001, 6:26 PM<BR> from IP address 204.186.177.197</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007778385'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Don, you just get here and what to start name calling, serf's and subjects. You want open bidding competition on this board and its been deemed to be an information forum by the guy paying the bills for it and you do not even know his name or affiliation. You want a open bidding forum, go to Ebay so get off you fing High horse. Most of the folks here might just know a lot more about NVG than you will ever be able to afford.<br>
<br>
Further, to make a blank post after making the statement you made, especially the RICO reference and to deny you cast aspersions on the dealers here trying to  explain the facts and shedding light on the dark side of the NV world to you is extremely disingenuous at best and mostly dishonest.<br>
<br>
What are you doing trying to cover your **&amp;%^ with the last of your post at best if that was you and if you did not you should have tried. Even so, it doesnt work here as your rant is rather pathetic. Here comes the Newby Don, with expectations and coming in too lazy to investigate before can invest as he must try and sell enough aluminum cans to buy something so he can know much of anything, at least admit it, you want the best deal spoon fed to you, how pathetic can you be, plenty. <br>
Got a question, ask it, but do not come here and pretend you know anything or call anyone here a serf or subject. I have been in this game for 25 years and you are the biggest joke I have seen in a while. Do you lurk around the tables at gun shows and tell the sheeple woo wee you can see in the dark with this!!!!!!! WOW get one, when you cant have it, afford it or did you get screwed, as you deserve with some Russian stuff. I wish I could meet you at a show and embarrass you in front of your momma. Serfs and subjects, Geez, youre a wasted piece of jizz running down a leg.<br>

			<P></center>Don, Ihave one of these, and I can tell you honestly, well in my opinion, it is a smashing little monocular.  All models of the 983 are submersible,  the 002 is the dive model, and comes with the lens windows to prevent distortion from contact with the water.   It has available camera, camcorder, weapons, helmet, and various facemask type headmounts, similar to the 7A type headmount/facemask.  It mounts left, right, or there is even a dual mount setup, so you can have 2 together and basically have an Anvis setup.  It has built in IR and also has the auto on/off headmount attachment feature.  It is a very nice unit, very good optics.   Guess Rich gave an idea of the retail on it.  <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 10, 2001, 8:10 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.99</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1008043836'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

you can buy IR laser diodes easily from a web based company... you dont need to be from military or government. I dont get why you all think you need <br>
permission from anyone to buy some simple laser diodes.. ohh and &quot;inrared&quot; is just the wavelenght.<br>
It does not make a laser diode different or special.<br>

			<P></center>I tracked down some of the FDA rules/memos on the subject.  Optical laser sights are not regulated if they are low power, not beyond required warning labels.  The idea is that they are visible and less of a risk to eyesight.  Similar lasers outside the visible range, regardless of power, are required to have optical lights and warning sounds when in operation.  This is of course stupid and annoying for an IR laser sight, so manufacturers wanting to sell such devices must request an exemption.  The exemptions are routinely granted with the provision sales are restricted to military and law enforcement who will get the proper &quot;training&quot; to use them safely without the warning lights/sounds.<br>
<br>
So, it isn't illegal to make one yourself (if you don't plan on selling it), or even own one.  It isn't illegal to sell the IR diodes as they are safe unfocussed and don't meet the FDA requirements.  Actual IR laser sights manufactured for commercial sale do come under the restrictions.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it makes complete sense or is fair or reasonable, just reporting the facts.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2001, 12:40 PM<BR> from IP address 140.252.3.23</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007757627'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>FDA regulations have the force of law, and while they do not make IR lasers &quot;illegal&quot; they do make explicit to whom a manufacturer may sell such a device.  An example of such an agreement can be found at:<br>
<br>

IR laser sights are categorized by the FDA as Class IIIb laser devices which must have a warning light/sound when in operation.  Deferences are granted, typically with the requirement that sales are only made to military or law enforcement.  The salient points from the above memo are:<br>
<br>
                    In lieu of the requirement referred to in Item E above, the following  conditions shall apply to the Class <br>

                    manufactured under this variance. <br>
<br>
                    1.       The sales of these laser aiming sights shall be restricted to government, military  and Iaw <br>
                             enforcement agencies under a direct purchase order from the agency and shall not be sold to <br>
                             individual  law enforcement personnel. <br>
<br>
                    2.       The user information to be supplied with  each laser weapon sight shall include: <br>
<br>
                             a.  Detailed written instructions on the radiation hazards of the Iaser sight and on its safe use <br>

<br>
1) They are not illegal.<br>
<br>
2) An &quot;agreement&quot; to selectively sell DOES NOT keep them out of the &quot;non-chosen&quot; peoples hands.<br>
<br>
Laws are in place to be gotten around.<br>
<br>
An &quot;agreement&quot; is not a &quot;law&quot;.<br>
<br>
Therefore they are not il-legal.<br>
<br>
In this case an &quot;agreement&quot; means nothing whatsoever , but instead is a wide open door to procure them by means of telling them whatever they need to hear to satisfy their conscious. <br>
<br>
Who cares what the company wnats done with it's product ? After they agree to ship it and do so , it's out of their control and can only be controlled thereafter by a LAW.<br>
<br>
There is NO LAW that can be affected against a person for possessing one.<br>
 <br>
It comes down to ONE thing and one thing only : <br>
<br>
Can you be arrested for possessing it ? - No<br>
<br>
Can you be arrested and/or prosecuted for obtaining a legal item in the United States by lying to a private company to obtain them ? - No<br>
<br>
If an item or action is not illegal , it is legal.<br>
<br>
Now ,what part of THAT is not crystal clear ? <br>

			<P></center>Owning or buying such a regulated item is not illegal and I never said it was, so you are in complete agreement with me.<br>
<br>
The FDA has allowed companies (in this case Insight) to avoid meeting certain product restrictions, but has placed new restrictions up them regarding the sales.  All the legal issues involve restrictions placed upon sales of such units.  That is beyond dispute from the FDA documents, so you must agree with this as well.<br>
<br>
I have no idea if any government agency actual cares about some private sales of these things in practice.  That's a separate issue I was not commenting on.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

<br>
The question of whether Insight can sell them to Joe Blow is not at issue.<br>
<br>
Obviuosly they (Insight) can not.<br>
<br>
But are &quot;we the people&quot; concerned with Insight's prior agreement with a regulating body ?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
So my steady argument through ALL of this remains true. It is that once the LAM's leave Insight in the prescribed manner , to the prescribed people (LE), after LE's hands any US citizen can own one should it come available to them.<br>
<br>
Obviuosly there are those out there working to be the middleman to make them obtainable to anyone with the cash , being as they are perfectly legal.<br>

Lets say i am an expert... and trust me! these people try to fool you. how can an IR illuminator cost so much... it makes no sense. IR laser diodes are not that expensive. Just dont tell me that these devices are powerful and thats why they cost so much. It is simply ridiculous... PLEASE dont pay so much money for such a silly device.<br>
<br>
A simple example without any complicated terms for cluless people: <br>
<br>
For 5000 dollars you can get a IR laser which can easily burn paper. Such a laser would be at least<br>
100 times more powerful than those silly infrared IR lumanitors. And note that those illuminators are so<br>
weak, they wont even producu heat. I say &quot;forget it&quot;.<br>

			<P></center>Guess the price of 70mw lasers?  I can tell you pretty close.  I just bought two Sanyo DL7140-201 785nm 70mw laser diodes for $67.43 each new factory boxed. They're under $44 if you buy ten. I chose that wavelength to match a CCD camera, not a gen III intensifier. Longer wavelength units aren't much more.  <br>
<br>
If you think an IR laser which can cut paper is bulky or has to be made of glass you're wrong.  It's about a 1/2&quot; cube most of which is a copper heatsink. 20 watts of 808 nm IR for $750 or 40 watts for $1043 from Thor Labs.<br>

			<P></center>I doubt a 20 watt laser would burn anything at 100 yards with the possible exception of someone's retina, but by defocusing it a little it would be useful for illuminating an area  several yards wide and a few feet tall to ranges well beyond 1000 yards.   It would still be focused better than is possible with LED's or incandescent bulbs.  It would also a tight enough beam not to cause backscatter in the near field which ruins the contrast.   Just the thing for the guys discussing shooting targets at 1000 yards.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>IR Laser Modules</b><br>by Doc<P></center>Ok guys.  All this IR laser talk is driving me nuts.<br>
<br>
Anybody can buy a 5mW 808 nm laser module from DigiKey.  They cost about $100 and have a focusing lens included.  They are about the size of a 38 casing and run on 3-15 VDC (about 50 mA for you tech folks out there).  I took one out to the desert last time I went out and I could easily see the dot at over 1500 yards with my Gen 3 PVS-7.  I know because I used a laser rangefinder to get the distance to the small car sized object that I &quot;lit up&quot; with the little module.  5 mW is the same power as a laser pointer.  If you don't believe me, take a red laser pointer and see how far you can see it with you night vision.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2001, 1:07 PM<BR> from IP address 12.234.240.236</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007759269'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I expect these digikey IR modules are general purpose, not designed only as laser sights for weapons.  They don't come with mounts, for instance?  If they do not have an indicator light/sound, they must have gotten a deference from the FDA.  Since they are not &quot;intended solely for the use of military/LE&quot; they probably were given their deferment with sales restrictions.<br>
<br>
I image it would be legal for someone else to develop and sell mounts for these, since the FDA does not regulate such.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2001, 1:56 PM<BR> from IP address 140.252.3.23</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007762165'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Note that if you're truly dark adapted a bluer color (aquamarine) at around 500nm will be detectable with the least energy.

dealer, serial# RSD34X<br>
<br>
Also, anyone have any advice/suggestions/personal experience with buying NVGs via a web auction?  Should I take a chance at the hopes of saving a lot of money or run away screaming?  Thanks.<br>

			<P></center>Last time it supposedly had the Int. tube replaced by someone and they told him it was a 51. When questioned he said &quot;that's what they sold it to me as&quot;. I'm sure it's probably a 45lp/mm. He said he bought it new , but then in an email said it had to be repaired. I assume that's why it has no spec sheet. He wouldn't answer several questions of mine last time either. Also you have no idea of how it's been cared for or what it's been exposed to. No warranty since it's too old. It's an ITT and not a Litton. <br>
<br>
I seen it on eBay also. I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. $2500.00 thrown away is a good chunk of a new one that you know the history on and get a spec sheet. The stories didn't jive , were too short and he was not very knowledgable. When pressed for more answers he got crappy with me.<br>
<br>
Good luck though....<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2001, 12:24 PM<BR> from IP address 204.212.198.182</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007756658'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

It'll probably cost you an extra $100, but it will give you the chance to return the unit within an agreed-to time-frame if it does not meet your expectations.

<br>
I have deleted some messeges that I have found to be offensive for this forum. I understand that one would like to make a point but I beleive that some messages have been excessive in etiquite. <br>
<br>
In regards to IR Laser sales in the U.S., the companies that manufacture such devices have a policy to sell these IR systems to Law Enforcement and Military only.<br>

			<P></center>It is certainly their policy, not mine,  and as I said in another post,  perhaps that can be changed.  In most cases money does talk, so instead of all the insults aimed at me,  why not try writing the manufacturer, and I suggest being a little more civil than a lot of these posts are.  Of course that suggestion will get me slammed some more I am sure, but all the same,  insults won't impress them much.<br>

			<P></center>....Did anyone ever tell you &quot;when you get yourself in a hole , STOP DIGGING &quot; ?????????<br>
<br>
Are you ever going to quit trying to vindicate yourself ? ,your first post was exteremely arrogant &amp; short sided , aloof &amp; dowright 'agin the American way.<br>
<br>
SCREW contacting the company , screw their policy. They aren't going to change it ! Are you that freaking naive ? <br>
<br>
We don't beg or plead to get someone to &quot;let&quot; us buy their product.<br>
<br>
They &quot;American way&quot; is to back-channel and end-run around ANY obstacle , thus getting what we want. <br>
<br>
Let me give you TWO pieces of advice to live your life by , given to me a LONG time ago and prove true every time.<br>
<br>
1) &quot;LAW'S &amp; RULES ARE IN PLACE FOR YOU TO FIGURE A WAY AROUND&quot;<br>
<br>
2) &quot;IT'S EASIER TO BEG FORGIVENESS THAN TO ASK PERMISSION&quot;<br>
<br>
In other words , why ask permission to get internal rules relaxed regarding sales of their damn product and get told no , when all you have to do is NOT ask and get them IN SPITE of them.<br>
<br>
THIS is what speaks louder than words.<br>
<br>
After a few months and them scrutinizing their sales records and following up end usage and realizing all these little PD depts. aren't really using them since they can't even afford or HAVE any NV , they just realize that despite their efforts they're getting out anyway.<br>
<br>
THAT is what burns , because at that point they realize how many THOUSANDS of dollars in profit they've lost to the secondary market profiteers that they could have taken themselves....<br>
<br>
Hit someone in the pocketbook DESPITE their best efforts.....inflames the afflicted party every time. <br>
<br>
In other words , we'll get 'em come hell or high water if we want 'em.<br>

			<P></center>I don't know why all the fuss over finding an IR laser. If you go to a typical electronics surplus store you can pick up a defective HP laserjet printer for next to nothing.  They each have a very nice ~5mw 790nm laser complete a collimator all ready to go. They are a sealed assembly and quite rugged.  Just add a resistor to set the current to about 30-40 ma with three penlite batteries.  Its bright enough to see at 1000 yards with a gen II.  Dot size is in the order of 1 moa.   <br>
You can also get a IR laser out of any CD rom drive.  Unfortunately those don't have a suitable collimator, but that's just a lens. The objective out of a small binocular will actually give a tighter beam than just about any commercial module. <br>
<br>
I suspect the whole &quot;limited manufacture&quot; is just a ploy to raise prices on what should be a $100 product. <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 7, 2001, 8:13 AM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007741608'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I know the one in the old HP Laserjet series II works well. Probably most others.  I've bought printers which looked ugly but were working as printers for as little as $20.  If the unit hasn't been opened there's a good chance the laser is ok even if it won't print.  Most laser printer failures are mechanical.   I posted here earler about how to calculate the resistor.  That was for LED's but the concept is the same. These lasers have about a 2 volt forward drop.  Buy a &quot;high brightness&quot; red led at radio shack to experiment with.  When you get it to light up you can put the laser in the circuit instead. You can do all the testing with just a volt/ohm meter and use your NV equipment to tell when it's working. Most of the difficulty is making an appropriate adjustable mount and battery holder. The thing which will kill a laser is electrostatic discharge.  Work on a grounded workbench and discharge yourself and tools before doing any soldering or lead attachment.  Use a small grounded soldering iron. <br>
<br>
I suggest you read and (and contemplate) this webpage:<br>
http://cord.org/cm/leot/course04_mod06/mod04_06.htm<br>
and particularly figure 18.  That's the minimum to do the job but it works.  Do not &quot;remote&quot; the switch in that diagram as the circuit offers no electrostatic protection. All the components should be inside a metal enclosure, including the battery.  The more complex circuits shown give better intensity stability and protection for the laser, but for a pointer it's not needed. <br>
<br>
These lasers are not truly &quot;eye safe&quot; in that they could do damage if you stare at one, but in practice they aren't much of a hazard. <br>

			<P></center>about DVD laser diodes. I hear they are capable of  multiple wavelenths . Do you know ? I have some of the HP4 laserjet diodes but they don't seem to be all that powerful. Maybe its the collimator i'm using......so many things to try this weekend.<br>

			<P></center>A typical printer laser isn't all that powerful.  The thing which makes them visible at long distances is being well focused.  5mw is not enough to do the job as an area illuminator. A watt isn't too much for that. <br>
~780 nm  diodes run about $1 per milliwatt (over 10mw).  I don't know what's used in an LJ4 (though there's a working one sitting on my desk).<br>
<br>
Two sources of IR diodes are:<br>
http://www.mi-lasers.com<br>
http://www.thorlabs.com<br>
<br>
(If you need a really hot area illuminator you can get a 20 watt 808nm laser array from Thor Labs for under $800! No, I didn't mean milliwatt.  Eyesafe? No way!) <br>
<br>
I don't have any experience with DVD lasers.<br>

<br>
Ok, for all you guys looking for those PEQ's and PAC's, unless you are LE or military, you should&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;WE &quot;SHOULD&quot; ? , WHO ASKED YOU TO TELL EVERYONE HERE WHAT THEY SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T DO ? WHERE'S THE INITIAL THREAD ? ARE YOU THE UNITED STATES SUPREME NIGHT VISION / INFRARED AIMER DESIGNEE OF ADVICE , LEGALITY &amp; MORALITY AND ARE GRACIOUSLY HUMBLING US WITH YOUR WISDOM ?  <br>
<br>
 consider using filtered visible lasers. Though the class 3 units are not stricly illegal, they are restricted by the manufacturer for reasons of liability and just plain common sense.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;SO ANYONE OTHER THAN AN 18 YEAR OLD GOVERNMENT TRAINED GI KID DOESN'T HAVE COMMON SENSE AND WE NEED YOU TO PINT THIS OUT TO US ?<br>
<br>
<br>
    Unfortunately some people just can't be trusted to have or use common sense&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? THE PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE IN THE MARKET FOR ONE AND WANT TO BUY ONE BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA AND WE &quot;CAN&quot; ?......&quot;SOME PEOPLE&quot; ?....IN CASE YOU STILL DON'T GET IT ,THAT IS A PERSONAL INSULT TO EVERYONE HERE ,EXCLUDING YOURSELF AND THE MANUFACTURER OF COURSE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH MORE INTELLIGENCE TO THAN US AND ARE QUALIFIED TO POINT THIS OUT TO US IDIOTS.  <br>
<br>
<br>
and even the class 3 IR's are quite dangerous to the human(or otherwise)eye as they are quite a bit more powerful than the little visible toys&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;THANKS ALOT , YOU SAVED US FROM OURSELVES JUST AS A DEMOCRAT LIKES TO DO , WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS THAT WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO BUY , WE ARE SO GRATEFUL MERCIFUL MASTER.<br>
<br>
<br>
Though we do take our priveleges seriously in this country, in reality there is no reason for anyone to need an IR laser&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;THIS IS &quot;IT&quot; , THIS COUNTRY IS NOT ANY KIND OF ABOUT WHAT ANYONE &quot;NEEDS&quot;.... MY GOD MAN...THIS WHOLE WORLD WAS BUILT ON PRODUCTS AND THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T &quot;NEED&quot;.....IF THE BATF HAD YOUR ATTITUDE NO ONE WOULD HAVE MACHINE GUNS BECAUSE IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT PEOPLE DON'T &quot;NEED&quot; THEM , BUT WHEN THEY (ATF) ASKS THE INDIVIDUAL WHY THEY WANT IT , THE ANSWER IS &quot;JUST BECAUSE i DO , AND BECAUSE I CAN&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
   and of course LE becomes a bit nervous about them in the wrong hands as well&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;WRONG HANDS ? WRONG HANDS ? HOW ABOUT WE ARE BECOMING AN UNWILLING PARTICIPANT IN A UN GOVERENED WORLD WHERE SOMEDAY YOUR CHILDREN MAY BE ACCOSTED BY SOME L.E. FROMA FORIEGN LAND WHO DOESN'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT BLOWING HIS BLOODY HEAD OFF AND MAKING AN EXCUSE LATER ? NO ONE IS SELLING THESE TO CAMEL JOCKEYS , WE ARE LOYAL AMRICANS HERE. WHAT GOOD WOULD ONE DO THEM ANYWAY ? ARE THEY GOING TO BACKENGINEEER ONE OUT OF ROCKS ? AND IF YOU THINK THEY DON'T HAVE ONE ALREADY IF THEY WANTED IT YOU'RE FOOLING YOURSELF MR.WORLDSAVIOUR.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I know we all have that mentality &quot;because I can&quot;, and that includes me as well&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;THANKS FOR THE SELF-AFFACING INDULGANCE DESINGED TO RALLY COMRADERIE. TRANSPARENT AS GLASS.<br>
<br>
 Unfortunately for us, the manufacturer can and does decide who can have them, and reasonably so in this day of lawsuits over spilt milk and so forth&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;NOT IN THE SECONDARY MARKET HE CAN'T.....HOW AND WHY DO YOU THINK MOST THINGS GET TO A SECONDARY MARKET ?  <br>
<br>
They can easily forsee the millions in lawsuits over careless eye damage, and are simply choosing to avoid them beforehand.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;MAYBE SO , BUT THEIR CHOICE OF WHO THEY INTIALLY LET THEM OUT TO NEGATES THE INCOMPETANT USE , EVEN IF NOT , YOU CAN NOT KEEP THINGS THAT EXIST OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE. IT CAN'T BE DONE AND ANYONE THAT TRIES IS AN ENEMY OBSTACLE.<br>
<br>
 Of course I for one don't think the FBI and some others should have them either&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;FINALLY SOMETHING HALF RIGHT , THE FACT IS THAT &quot;WE&quot; SHOULD HAVE THEM AND &quot;THEY&quot; SHOULDN'T.<br>
<br>
<br>
 but hopefully they have some training and adult&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;ADULT ? NICE INSINUATION THAT &quot;WE&quot; THE PEOPLE THAT WANT THEM ARE NOT ADULTS THAT &quot;CAN BE TRUSTED&quot;   supervision before being allowed&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;ALLOWED ? NO ONE ALLOWS ME TO DO ANYTHING THAT IS LEGAL , IT'S &quot;MY&quot; CHOICE. NOT THEIRS OR YOURS.<br>
<br>
<br>
 to use them, and hopefully they have some better guideance than we have seen over the past 10 years&lt;&lt;&lt;PABLUM<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
Anyway, for now, might as well quit asking unless you have a LE letter&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;READ &quot;YOU&quot; MIGHT AS WELL QUIT ASKING , WHICH IS WHAT I'M SURE YOU TYPED BEFORE YOU BACKED OUT THE &quot;YOU&quot;. AND I'LL BE DAMED IF i'LL QUIT ASKING MATTER OF FACT YOU JUST INSPIRED ME TO GET ALL THE PERFECTLY LEGAL UNRESTRICTED PAQ-4C'S I CAN GET MY HANDS ON IF I WANTED TO....SEE WHAT HEPPENS WHEN YOU TELL A GUNNY &quot;NO&quot; ? REMEMBER WHAT HAPENS EVERY TIME THEY TRY AND BAN A GUN ? IT JUST COMES BACK OUT IN A DIFFERNT WAY AND/OR FORM , IT'S USELESS AND YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO EVER MAKE THAT STATEMENT IN PUBLIC.<br>
<br>
  purchase order, etc, etc, or you are a dealer selling to LE or the military. <br>
Sorry to dissappoint you all&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;AGAIN , WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO FOIST AN ELITIST ARROGANT COMMENT LIKE THAT ON US ? SPEAKING DOWN TO ALL US PEONS HUH ? WHAT UNMITIGATED GAUL AND ODASSITY. <br>
<br>
 but that is the current sales policy, and if you know of a dealer selling them to &quot;just anyone&quot; I would advise not&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;WHO GIVES A RATS ASS WHAT YOU ADISE , THEY'RE LEGAL. GO STARIGHT TO HELL.<br>
<br>
YOU INSULTED EVERYONE A MULTITUDE OF TIMES WITH THIS SUPREMELY ARROGANT POST , I FOR ONE CAN NOT BELIEVE ONE MAN'S HEAD COULD EVER BE THIS BIG BESIDES CLINTONG , HITLERY OR SCHUMER. GO SOAK IT.<br>

I'm afraid it will soon be, &quot;no need for anyone to own a night vision riflescope&quot;. Then, no need to own 'any' night vision device, no need to own body armor, no need to own a kevlar helmet, no need to own 'any' handgun. No need for anyone to own 'any' gun.<br>
<br>
We in CA are headed this way. When we fall, PA and most of the rest of the USA won't be far behind.<br>

			<P></center>You see,  you are reading too quickly and not thinking clearly.  I specifically said &quot;need&quot;  not have for a reason. So as not to p... anyone off. Do you &quot;need&quot;  a motorcycle?  Do you &quot;need&quot; 3 AR-15's?  Do you &quot;need&quot; an IR laser device?  Absolutely not!  Do we all love those things-absolutely.  Should be be able to have them? Sure, as long as we are responsible with them, but in this case the manufacturer also has some rights doesn't he?   Do you only believe in your personal rights,  now who is sounding like the liberal here.  The private owners of a company cannot decide who they want to sell to??  Hmmmm  what country was this again.  You see how easy it is to become one of &quot;them&quot;  when your view of personal freedoms stops at the mirror?   <P><center><i>Posted on Dec 6, 2001, 6:09 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.44</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007690964'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>I'm the first . . .</b><br>by anon<P></center>to support a manufacturer's (or anyone's) right to sell or not sell to anyone. I'm retired from the manufacturing/repair business myself and though my product was not 'sensitive' like guns/NV/etc. I did set my own limits on who/what I worked for.<br>
<br>
Do I need a motorcycle? No! Do I need an IR laser? No! Carried to a realistic conclusion: I really don't need guns [the chances of me needing to defend myself with one are statistically very small], I don't need NV equipment either, for that matter, though I've spent nearly $9000 on the hobby so far.<br>
<br>
However, I choose to own guns because of that infinitesimally small chance I might need them. I choose to own NV stuff because it is inherently bitchin'.<br>
<br>
I choose NOT to own a motorcycle any more because I'm old and prefer the comfort of an aircondx car or truck.<br>
<br>
The point is . . . I'm &quot;choosing&quot; these things. I suspect 'we' are more alike than different in our values and beliefs. Probably if given a chance to re-word your original post 'slightly differently' your stance on freedoms would not have been so fuzzy to the rest of us.<br>
<br>
As aluded to in my original post, some of us in California are really fed up with the way things are going. CA should be a warning to all!<br>

			<P></center>pretty level headed in this heated non-debate, which seems to have degraded to merely name-calling and insults, and totally baseless, I might add.  I have re-read the original post, which I have asked all to do carefully, and see that some of us at least, do think the same. I do not defend the govt of Cal for taking whatever rights were taken, nor do I defend those who let them be taken.  I stated in the original that I, like you all, like these great toys, and useful items such as NV, guns of all sorts, IR lasers, and motorcycles. However, the manufacturer also has the right to decide who should own his products, no matter how flawed his thinking might be. The FBI, like I trust them with IR lasers?  Like I said,  with adult supervision maybe.   I only posted originally to help answer some availability questions a couple guys had asked, and nowhere in that posting are my opinions of who should &quot;HAVE&quot; IR lasers, other than maybe the FBI shouldn't &quot;HAVE&quot; them.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 6, 2001, 8:06 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.44</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007697980'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>you read carefully and remember that LT was actually saying we should all register our guns and we shouldn't have this and that.  I am just saying that for now,  we can't have those nice tasty littly IR laser aimers that looks so good on the old AR.  Perhaps they will come up with a lower powered one that is eyesafe?  Maybe if all the name callers get in touch with the makers of PAC-4 and so on, and call them lots of filthy names and really really insult them badly,  they will change their policy?

			<P></center>please go back and read through the whole thing.  I carefully watched what I said and tempered everything that sounded like Sara Brady with some common sense stuff too.  I did say there really is not reason, but because we WANT to, because we can.  I also want these great toys, but they are just that, toys for most of us.  Try not jumping on me for simply trying to explain the situation as it stands.  I don't make the rules, or the policies.   I have to live with them whether I like them or not,  unless I can change them.  Perhaps we can find some ways to change these policies concerning lasers,  but it won't be by insulting your friendly dealers(me) without actually reading and then thinking through what they are telling you.  I didn't say you can't have them,  or should not have them.  I simply said that currently, without LE or military applications, or perhaps some LE help or involvement of some kind, or being a dealer, you will probably not be able to get one.  That is all.  So please don't confuse me with LT, as that is not a very nice thing to say, and it hurts my feelings greatly.  I am just trying to answer some questions that have been popping up all over the place, not making any kind of political stand on who should have what.   <br>

if you had you would know that they ARE eye safe as far as the FDA is concerned, which at .7 miliwatts is understandable and its says so right on the unit itself. Your correct the MFG. And dealers may certainly elect not to sell anything they desire, pity, but fine with me and I doubt anyone here would disagree that they have that right If I am mistaken please let me know so I can tell you are mistaken.<br>
Further, I have not even read the all of the post but I think I understand what you meant by needs vs wants. I might want 3XXX but all I need is 1x  but I as am ABLE to do better than just my wants and thereby fill my wants. No problem there either. And as long as those wants are legal no problema. And so it goes and that's what makes the world go around as another poster pointed out.<br>
I think others might have been  somewhat confused on this point, as they appear to think somehow your advocating  we should not have access to something legal that we cannot use safely and responsibly. I believe your words were interpreted as that if the government so determined we cant be safe and responsible, now that is what gets Folks hackles up and therein lies the rub in this discourse and I think I agree with the crowd. But we all here know that there ARE such things that the government was correct to determine could not be held or had by all, Like a personal self-defense  A bombs, Stinger Missiles and the like or Title 2 weapons in the hands of idiots and other folks (people, not governmental entities, they have them already!!) that can't control themselves. No one here is bitching about that.<br>
And there is most definitely at least one NEED for IR lasers in non LEO/Military hands and that need is varmint hunting (where it is legal to do so, like in Texas) as even a filtered laser, which is a joke, will still spook the hell out of coyotes and they will leave AO at MACH 4 like  their hair was on fire. Can the device be abuse, like anything else YES it can but so what !! Just because some slob can or does cause damage should not mean the rest of us should suffer in any way whatsoever. That kind of thinking is without question very very stupid and is what got us where we are today with bans on semi autos and the like and he heading into the future with outrageous safety precautions after 9/11 at eh airports, nail files, give me a break.<br>
<br>
Finally, Mr. H was not referring to you as LT in his post at all you  as he knows that you are not taking that extreme of a position at all  and neither should anyone else. You jumped the gun there.<br>
Rant off<br>

			<P></center>as I have used both kinds and whenever I fired up the visible laser and it hit a blade of grass the bloom sppok the yotes something awful and the bloom on thier fur made bullet placement practically a moot point. Disappointed me to no end. I switched to IR and it was all better. In fact I would really consider a visible laser more of an illuminator than an aimer under some circumstances in fact I kind of like the idea of defocusing the beam in some manner so as not to scatter light like a red lens spotlight.<br>

<br>
 and I do not mean to get anything going like that but when I initially began my foray towards the pvs 14 I was goin to set it up like thearmy did with an Aimpoint Comp M (it even comes in a 2 power now) but I read hereand thought before then that a lighted retivle in front of a NV scope can cause a burned image in the center of the scope with its dot in the case of the Aimpoint, even on the NV setting just like what happend on occasion with the PVS 4 with its forward lit reticle. Its fine idea if you only turn onthe reticle dot to shoot and then turn it off but that is not realistice at  all in practice and that is why I have searched for an IR laser. There may be alternatives out there but not much better for the pvs 14 that I am aware of. Lots of luck<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Burn from sights &amp; IR with animals</b><br>by Mike M<P></center>That one of the reasons I recommend wearing the PVS-14 vice mounting it. (The sight won't sit locked on one spot on the Aimpoint/EOTech and get burned. Another is you can look around more freely without having to point the weapon everywhere was another reason. But thats just personal preference. <br>
<br>
I mentioned it quite a while ago about the IR laser. Has anyone (that has one) tried it to see if dogs or cats respond to it? The ITT LE guy told us that they can see it and will chase it?? I tried it with two cats now (using a Night Stalker power grip) IR laser, no response, visible.... they go nuts. (maybe it only works with dogs??)<br>
<br>
The story he gave was when our troops were illuminating area's (or people), the enemy didn't have a clue but the dogs were going nuts chasing it....<br>

At a half mile away the spot was bright enough that i was worried about burning my intensifier so i kept moving it around....but i you can't move it to much. If you accidently point it at a military aircraft THEY WILL BE PISSED!!! I have a Siberian Husky and i'll see if she can see the beam. <br>
I'll post tonight.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Questions</b><br>by Jay<P></center>A lot of people feel gun-mounted visible lasers aimers are nothing more than toys, mainly because it takes longer to acquire a target with a laser than it does with a sight, plus if you're working as part of a laser-equipped team, there can be confusion in establishing which targeted laser is actually yours.<br>
<br>
Now it's the first argument that concerns me: would you say targeting with a PAQ-4C is just as fast and accurate as using gun sights set up for night vision?<br>
<br>
Second, I'm going to try using an ACOG TA31A scope with the 14's.  Do I run the risk of damaging the NVD with the bright red triangular reticle in the ACOG, or is this is safer system than the Aimpoint?<br>

			<P></center>Yes, the PAQ-4C is great. <br>
<br>
And, if you leave the PAQ-4C turned on, and stare at it long enough you will burn the tube as well.<br>
<br>
ANY IR / visible aimer or RED or GREEN reflex / holographic aimer using in conjunction with an image intensified system runs the risk of burning the tube if  the tube &quot;stares&quot; at it long enough.  Wear a head mounted PVS-14D with the aimer and you SHOULD be ok.  Just move your head and only turn the aimer on when you are ready to shoot, AND avoid pointing the aimer at reflective surfaces.<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 8, 2001, 1:30 PM<BR> from IP address 204.186.177.197</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007847046'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

				</noscript>
			<P></center>I hate to spend 3000.00 on a PVS14 , because knowing me , if I do I'll just go ahead and spend 4200.00 for a PVS14D. So I'm wondering if there's a small weapons / handheld / headmountable unit out there in 3rd gen. for 2K or under that's worth a darn (and would have a data sheet)....<br>
<br>
Any such animal ?  <br>
<br>
      I've only been studying these and looking to buy for a couple of months but have read everything &amp; every thread I could find , so I'm about 2% of an expert but understand the game somewhat. Just arent familiar with all the models there are or have been since I had decided to buy a 14 early on. <br>
<br>
     Is there a unit that I could maybe backup to about $2,000.00 or so and still get long life , built in IR and some of the performance of a gen3 ? <br>
<br>
     From pics I've seen it looks like the gen2 picture would be good enough for what I need it for , I don't really need perfect clarity and the ability to pick out facial features and identify people , they're all going to look the same from a distance if things go to hell. (er , uh , for hunting I mean)<br>
<br>
    Does light gathering in overcast/non starlight situation necessarily have to drop back to 2nd gen. performance just to pay less for a unit than a pvs14 or 14D ?<br>
<br>
    Am I wrong in my whole approach here ?<br>
<br>
I'm all ears....<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>other choices!!</b><br>by code-1<P></center>A gen gen two unit will not give you a good picture at low light levels. If I was you I would look at a USNV faclon 3rd gen or 121m 2+ with tube sheet. These can be had from around 1600 to 2200 dollars with new tubes in them. A weapon mount is around 80 dollars for them too. The PVS-14 is worth the extra money if you have it,but sometimes we have to go with something a little less costly so we can pay our bills on time. The 121m with gen 2+ will double the performance of a plain gen  121 gen 2 tube.Good Luck!!<P><center><i>Posted on Dec 6, 2001, 3:41 PM<BR> from IP address 24.116.29.56</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1007682099'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

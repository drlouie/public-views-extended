I'm interested in purchasing a Gen III NV unit. At this point I inclined towards either a 6015/PVS-14 or PVS-7 goggles. <br>
<br>
My primary interests are security and general fun. I'm not that interested (at this point) in photography or videography.<br>
<br>
For security, I'll be using NV for pistols equipped with tritium sights (maybe adding laser sights)and a rifle equipped with Trijicon Reflex sights.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts, observations and experiences would be much appreciated in helping me make an expensive purchase that I won't later regret ;-) Thanks in advance.<br>

			<P></center>i have not tried a pvs14 but i know there are plenty of guys here that have so you WILL hear from them too!<br>
<br>
on the pvs7's, i dont mind walking in mono, and i like having both eyes locked into nite vizion. i have tried walking with just one eye on the pvs7's and it's kinda hard to walk (for me) when one eye has NV and the other is dealing with darkness. <br>
<br>
as for shooting a gun with night sites or an AR15 w/a reflex/aimpoint etc. it does not work for me. if you focus your NV on the gun/sites then your target is a blur. if you focus your NV on the target then the glow of the nite site is blooming so much you cant use it. lasers will work for sighting in on the target but as someone will warn you; DONT USE VISIBLE LASERS WITH YOUR NV! i think in a pinch a few laser tracks across your nv tube to save your life is OK. :-)<br>
<br>
.02$ worth of info.<br>

			<P></center>I have a PVS-14 and a set of PVS-7s.  The 14 in a headmount as a monocular works for walking around, but it's definitely something I had to practice at in uneven terrain.  <br>
<br>
With either one, using the normal Tritium night sights is tough, they're WAY too bright and if you focus on them the target is very hard to see.  Either NVD with an IR laser on the weapon is a much more workable solution out to quite considerable ranges.  A visible laser on the weapon doesn't work nearly as well, but is visible, barely.<br>
<br>
If you were interested in using NV with a rifle there's another practical option, one of the red-dot sights which has night vision levels of brightness control.  Aimpoint makes a good one that I use with the PVS-14 in a weapon mount directly behind it.  The 14 can also be used mounted behind a conventional scope, but the field of view that's adequate in the daytime now has to be used to find the target as well as align the weapon, and it's a lot tougher.<br>
<br>
The final option I like is one of the holo-sights with night-vision capable brightness controls on a handgun or rifle and either NVD in the headmount.  It actually works tolerably well with practice with a handgun, still pretty clumsy with a rifle.  Getting your head and the NVD aligned with the sight on a rifle is just really awkward.<br>
<br>
My recommendation is buy what you want, try it out, and sell/trade to what your experiences suggest.  These things do hold their value.  You'll also probably get a lot of responses here with more info than I've offered.<br>

			<P></center>You will need to decide whether you want an eye &quot;free&quot; for peripheral use or just because you are more comfortable that way.  If you have ski or dirt bike goggles try putting some black paper with a 3/4&quot; hole for each eye, then walk around that way.  That will give you a bit of an idea what wearing the goggles with eyecups is like. (this is not a scientific test) then just do it over one eye. Of course the darkness is another whole story, but lots of guys like one eye &quot;free&quot; for normal night vision while having a monocular on the one eye.  Without the eyecups it is actually a lot nicer, as you don't feel as closed in, and you can see around the goggle.  <br>
  As for handgunning with either using the tritium sight,  it is very awkward and not very good at all.  You cannot focus on the sight and anything more than 7 or so feet away at the same time.  If that is your plan,  better to invest in a small laser aimer and filter it, as guys have discussed,  or you can use the IR stuff that is available to law enforcement (or to anyone from some dealers).   The headgear is the same for the PVS-7 and 14, you can get all the same image tube specs for them.  One thing with the monocular is that you will make better use of the tube,as it is basically a straight through light path, so the image will always look better through the mono.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 17, 2002, 4:51 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.37</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011315103'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<br>
I use a 14 for walking, scouting and checking on things that go bump in the night.  I have had no problems with the mono tube/ eye adapatbilty.  It's nice to have one eye acclimated to the darkness.  You would be surprised how well your one eye will adapt to the low light.  As far as a weapon goes I have not tried a laser, but know that night sights on a pistol do not work.  Not enough depth of focus.  The filtered laser would be the way to go (or just point shot at close range.)<br>
<br>
Of course I'm partial to the 14s as I have not tried the 7s.

			<P></center>Besides a laser pointer one form of pistol scope which works with night vision viewers are the reflex dot scopes like the &quot;C-More&quot;.  The problem with even them is that they're way too bright but at least they produce a sharp and properly focused image. A little surgery on the current limiting resistor can fix the brightness problem since it's an LED and not a laser. <br>

			<P></center>have a range of very dim settings just for use with NVDs.  The EO Tech, the Bushnell and the Cmore all are in this category, and there are probably others.  They actually work quite well with a head/helmet mounted monocular or PVS-7s.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>One eyed jack...</b><br>by RJ<P></center>I have also found when using a monocular goggle rig with either variable gain or objective lens manual aperture control...<br>
<br>
... you can adjust the NV assisted so that your brain can see just enough of both eyes to give you a stereo field of view. This technique works best when there is enough available light for the unassisted eye to make out atleast a little detail. You can then up the gain or open the lens aperature, so that the NV eye offers more detail. With the NV monocular properly aligned, both the NV eye and unassisted eye will blend together very nicely.<br>
<br>
I have used this technique with a headed mounted monocular setup with a 25mm objective featuring a manual aperature. It made a nice difference when trying to navigate the woods.<br>
<br>
As the environments gets ever darker this two eyed technique is less effective, so it you will benefit from sone single eye NV assisted practice.<br>
<br>

			<P></center>I've tried both,  I still like the goggle,  though I use it without the eyecups most of the time.  I don't have them for the A and C anyway,  and prefer it without.  The monocular is still nice for just grabbing and spotting around quickly though.   I guess it boils down to personal choice in the long run.  Also whether you have other uses in mind such as camera or weapon mounting.<br>

			<P></center>As an anarcho-libertarian, my first response is 'then there's a good chance it's wrong'.  However as a long-time engineering employee of the Navy, I have to acknowledge that for the folks we send into harms way, we do try awfully hard to do it right.<br>
<br>
I thought of something else that's a plus for the monocular approach that I don't recall seeing mentioned here.  The screen you're looking at with either is far brighter than the outside world when you're using these things.  With the PVS-7's, if you need to remove them for whatever reason, BOTH eyes are seriously night-blinded for what seems like many minutes (probably no more than 20-30 seconds even for my eyes though).  With the mono, you can just close the eye you were using with the NVD and still have dark-adapted vision in the other.  A non-trivial point I think.<br>
<br>
I've tried training myself to close that non-NVD'd eye when shooting (PVS-14D on an M4, usually) to retain the dark adaption, but that does require some practice.<br>

			<P></center>Actually the D303 is a very good value for the money.  It is well made, of all new components, including new US image tube.  It also has a 2 year warranty.  If you could get a PVS-7 in gen 2, which you can,  it would be more money, so you can't evenly compare them price wise.  If you are worried that it is made in a housing from Eastern Europe, well sorry to say, there are only a few NV devices that are made completely here in the US.   Just because the parts are made outside the US doesn't make them bad, otherwise no one would buy the PVS-7's, Raptors or any of that stuff with housings and other parts made in other countries under contract.  <br>
  I have seen some really crappy PVS-7's that have been put together out of parts, with pieces missing, mis-fit or damaged.  Not to say there aren't any,  but if you don't buy a new one from the manufacturers(Litton/ITT) then you won't have the manufacurer's warranty or guarantee of quality.  You also get a 10 day return guarantee with the 303.  If you can find another 700 bucks, go for a gen 3 PVS-7. Otherwise try out the 303.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 17, 2002, 5:18 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.211</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011273494'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

  Have you ever had the opportunity to view a genuine, eastern european manufactured Gen II tube? Do any of the EU firms actually manufacture a real MCP tube and if so, how does it compare to a Litton or ITT.<br>
  Every EU unit I've ever seen -- with the exception of those specifically manufactured with US tubes -- was just a Russian Gen 1. As a side note, I've also examined some so-called Gen I+ and didn't find anything notable about them over &quot;regular&quot; Gen I.<br>
  As posters have previously pointed out, with no standards or regulation, &quot;Gen I+&quot; can apparently mean anything the advertiser wants it to mean...<br>
  Of three &quot;Gen I+&quot; examples I recently examined, a Newcon Optic waterproof marine model, a Timer long distance scope with a cat mirror lens and an AMTn Viper mono-goggle, the Newcon and Timer seemed to exhibit less of the typical Gen I edge distortion and the AMTn was -- to my far from expert eye -- just typical Gen I. None of them were bad, all had pretty good resolution, but the resolution and light gain was no better than my 3 year-old Night Owl NOCC3.<br>
<br>
Best regards<br>

			<P></center>some really crummy, very antiquated gen 1 &quot;Russian&quot; tubes,  and there are some pretty nice ones.  If one calls them gen 1 plus, well I guess they can if they want.   I have seen both,  and the newer type with the larger screen and input window are not bad,  some quite nice.  As for the gen 2  I have one here you can play with if you want to.  It is an almost exact copy of the 9644, other than it is pretty crappy, and uses a partial external power supply for some reason.  There actually are gen 2 and 3 copies of most of our stuff from the 70's and 80's, most of it not real nice.  Now the European tubes(Photonis or Photonix) are another story. You probably know all about them though?<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 17, 2002, 4:40 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.37</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011314455'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I was also looking at both units and I ended up with the PVS14 and I'm glad I did, mostly because of the variable gain. I use it all the time. It's good when there is too much light and you are not getting enough contrast or too little light and you need to tweek it up a tad. From what I understand it helps your tube last longer when you turn it down whenever possible. I always turn mine all the way down and slowly raise it up until I am satified with the image, that way I get plenty of contrast and I am not overworking the tube.<br>
I'm brand new to all this but I would say it would be hard for me to buy another piece of NV without the feature, but that's just me.<br>

			<P></center>the manual gain,  there are some other slight differences between the 6015 and the NQ/PVS-14(not the AN/PVS-14).  The 6015 can be camera mounted, so there must be some difference in the ocular assy.  I am not sure of this, or what the difference is, but I am pretty sure the PVS-14 does not have the camera option, so there must be a difference in the ocular somewhere.   Chris would know all the differences to the screw sizes I would think.  There might be some other ITT experts weighing in on this,  certainly I am not one, nor have I compared the 2 items, other than in the books.  <br>
   The manual gain is nice in some situations,  I don't know if this adds to the possible failure statistics of the 6015 or not.  You know how it goes sometimes,  one more accesssory is one more thing to go wrong or wear out.  I am surely not saying this is the case,  just something more to check out and ask questions about.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 16, 2002, 10:36 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.84</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011249370'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I was just basing that on 2 ads for the units, and the one  did not list any camera option for the NQ PVS-14.  Yes the AN is Army Navy.  Anything with that designation will be a military spec item,  or should be.  As for the housing,  I cannot give detailed differences.  I don't think they are major, but the AN/mono can be nitrogen purged, while the NQ doesn't have the fitting I am told.  I am not sure if the actual material is somewhat different or not. I will see if I can find out.<br>

			<P></center>I own two NVPS-10's, one second and one third gen. They both have an iris on the 1X lens they came with. Sometimes when I adjust the iris I can see light reflecting off the iris. Not a bad glare or anything, but it's there in the right light conditions. I'm betting you don't get that slight disadvantage with adjustable gain. I look at the iris as a poor man's adjustable gain in fact. I don't know about more scintilation and all in one or the other, never used a scope with adjustable gain. Just the little bit I know or think I do on this.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 17, 2002, 4:28 PM<BR> from IP address 152.163.206.181</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011313736'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>almost the same</b><br>by tech fix<P></center>Good observation Juiceman. they are basically identical except for the gain control. If you'll notice the filled in hole on the front of the 6015 thats where the 50K potentiometer goes on the PVS-14. The main difference is in the power supply. It has the suface contacts just like the standard 10160 tube but in addition it also has two wires coming out of it for the gain control so it has four leads just like the PVS-4 tubes. I potted a few of these a couple of years ago and the tubes themselves were all the same. In regard to mil spec. basically even if the tube has blems as long as they meet the criteria ( only so many spots per zone 1,2, and 3 and the spots are under certain sizes, and the blem will not interfere with the operators completion they will still pass. I've seen some brand new goggles that were delivered to a unit I was visiting and they were horrible. blems all over but they were still mil spec. <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 17, 2002, 3:55 AM<BR> from IP address 64.157.125.9</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011268538'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Does the tube pick up the &quot;flickering&quot; of a pulsed laser, or it will &quot;blend&quot;, giving the impression of a steady illumination?<br>
At what threshold the IIT will start flickering?<br>
This, because I found on ebay a small IR, 904nm laser module (LED) that has a pulsed power of (!!!!) 34 Watts at some 40 A (Item # 1322548631).<br>
I imagine that if the pulses are close enough, with 34 W I could illuminate a square 100 feet area a mile away!<br>
I know it would be very complicated to build a portable pulsed 40A PS, but I like to play with the idea.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 16, 2002, 2:43 PM<BR> from IP address 62.11.126.211</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011221007'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Pulsed laser</b><br>by

			<P></center>To the  first part of your question, the photocathode and electron multiplier have very fast response but the phosphor on a NV tube has a persistance in the order of 50 milliseconds.  The human eye persistance is about that speed too. Some of the older tubes are a little slower. If you pulse a laser at  50 hz or faster you won't see any flicker.  At 30 hz you might see a bit.  At 10 hz you will see pulsation.<br>
<br>
Read the specs on the laser carefully. The 34 watt rating of the LD68 M/A-Com laser is PEAK power.  These lasers have a fairly low duty cycle. You won't get 1 watt average out of it. Perhaps 100mw or a little more, the specs shown don't say and I don't know.   I have a couple of LD65 models (~12 watt rating).  I paid $25 each for mine surplus but sealed in it's factory package. I plan to use them in a wind velocity meter which can operate with a 1:1000 duty cycle <br>
<br>
The one on ebay is likely to be good but it doesn't sound like it's guaranteed and it is out of the package.  Note the 1983 date on the box.  The seller calles it &quot;rare&quot; but thats no doubt because they haven't been made for years. You'll probably have trouble finding data about duty cycle and power dissapation.  I haven't found any for mine.<br>
<br>
Most diode lasers don't handle pulses more than about 2 times their CW rating.  The M/A-COM 904nm ones do have a much higher peak to average ratio than most.  Their typical use was for time-of-flight rangefinders. It may make a decent illumintor but the requirement to pulse it makes it more difficult to use and it certainly won't meet the expectations you stated above.<br>
<br>
A driver can be made with a few resistors, a capacitor, and an SCR or power MOSFET as a switch plus an oscillator to trigger it.  You should be able to run it from small 12v battery.  The capacitor has to put out 75 amps (or a little less) pulses but the battery doesn't. If you can get the laser cheap it might be fun to experiment with.  Set up to produce 1 microsecond pulses at a 3khz rate you might get over 100 mw average with only a few watts drawn from the battery.  It's also very easy to turn one of these into junk by over driving it.  <br>

			<P></center>I've been looking at some possibilities for IR illuminators. All have some drawbacks.<br>
<br>
You are right about the grainy look of lasers. Any stable monocrhomatic light source will do that.  The advantage of lasers is they (most) have a very tiny emission area which can be focused with a small lens or slightly defocused to a small round spot. With appropriate optics there will be little off axis light.   If you only illuminate a small area even a long range  it doesn't take a lot of power. <br>
 <br>
One solution to the &quot;grainy&quot; problem is to use multiple wavelengths.  Two lasers are very unlikly to be on exactly the same wavelegth so when the two beam add their patterns  the fringes move around at such high speed the motion isn't visible. Two lasers will require two sets of optics to make them add at the target.  <br>
<br>
New (not surplus) CW lasers I've looked at with<br>
reasonable prices which might be suitable for NV illuminators include:<br>
<br>
Sanyo   785nm 80mw     $68  Should lite up a 2 meter spot at 500 meters with gen II, 1000m with gen III.  Probably slighty visible. <br>
<br>
IMC     808nm 20 Watt  $700 (line output 46 diodes) (Could easily light up a 50 meters of horizon at a mile for a gen II or III with an appropriate lens I'm not recommending it at all.) <br>
<br>
Sanyo   830nm 100mw    $323 (probably about ideal for a gen II or gen III spot illuminator though no brighter for gen II than the 785 nm 80mw unit. Should be totally invisible).<br>
<br>
Thorlab 980nm 1 watt   $210 (too far in the IR for  gen II or III but would work great with the extended IR Gen III and some CCD cameras. <br>
<br>
Another long range available with a fairly big spot is a MaxiBeam light.  This is a short arc 70 watt xenon lamp in a portable spotlight size package.  With an IR filter you'd have no trouble seeing with a decent gen II at a mile. It will give around 10 watts of IR.  They cost about $1700.   <br>
<br>
Actually a flashlight with decent focus and an IR filter will give good illumination with a Gen II to 400 yards or more. <br>
<br>
I like the Streamlight &quot;Ultrastinger&quot;.  It's just a tiny halogen bulb powered by nicads with a 2&quot; parabolic reflector. That works quite well.  It's about $90 with charger plus you need a filter.  That should be about $50 for a good glass one.  It puts out about a watt of IR in a &lt;5 degree beam. Quite a bit of IR off axis too. <br>
<br>
There are also high power LED's which are much cheaper than lasers. They're problem is that they have a fairly large emission area, larger even than some halogen bulb filaments.  They do put out IR only but typically over a band from 750 to 950 nm, peaking between 850 to 880 nm.  To make that into a bright spot at 400 yards requires about a 4&quot; fast lens or paraboliic mirror.  The LED;s are fairly cheap.  100mw for about $10.  There are some 1/2 watt and higher LED's on the market but they are usually multiple chips presenting even a worse problem in trying to focus them to a reasonable spot at several hundred yards.  You could use several of single chip ones with a 30mm or so lens aimed at the same spot.  If compact is the objective you'll do better with a laser.  The LED's are the way to go if you want a 5 to 10 degree beam for viewing out to a couple of hundred meters.  They're very easy to use and efficient. <br>
<br>
Any of these IR light sources can be unsafe to look at if focused or collimated, or directly at close range. The higher power ones could cause blindness and not just the lasers.  By using them in a diverging mode only with moderatly large beams none present an extreme hazard.  If you build one of these treat it with respect.  Understand the energy densities involved and the potential of danger from reflections.   Eye protection from IR light at these levels is inexpensive and available. <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 17, 2002, 9:41 AM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011289299'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Yes, I should get rid of my lasers.  One careless slip and I could blind myself or get a minor burn.  I should also get rid of my firearms, I could blow my head open like a dropped pumpkin.    I'd better also get rid of my dirt bike.   I have hurt myself a few times with that.   And then there's that awful jeep which is likly to roll and smash me flat.  You're right,  Instead I should just sit in front of a TV, drink beer, and die of somthing natural like heart disease.<br>

			<P></center>A gen 1 or gen II tube (normally) has an S20 multialkali photocathode.  That has it's peak response about 470 nm and falls off fairly smoothly to near zero around 1000nm.   A gen I or II tube has about 30% of it's peak sensitivity at 850nm.  <br>
<br>
If you want a broad beam and plenty of IR light you'll probably get better illumination with the standard Maglite bulb and a filter which cuts around 790 nm. 78mw is a lot for a collimated laser pointer but it isn't much as an illuminator. The LED may give less battery drain. That's the only advantage I can see.   <br>
<br>
Even 880nm LED's have a visible glow.  The stated wavelength is the peak  and unlike a laser the spectral range of an LED is pretty broad.  I don't the specs of your diode but some 100mw 880 nm diodes are only down to 10% ouput at 780nm and 970nm. (per http://www.optodiode.com).

Regarding IR filters - I haven't yet seen a flashlight type IR filter advertised with details of it's cut-off frequency. Any pointers you can give me to something which will be appropriate ?<br>

			<P></center>I don't know what's available to you easily in the UK.<br>
For a low power flashlight (10 watts or less) I'd just get an IR photographic filter.  A Kodak #87 will give fairly good throughput with a faint visible red glow.  A #87C will have less glow but also let through less useful IR.  These are decent filters but not designed to absorb a lot of energy.   They come in 3&quot;, 4&quot;, or 6&quot; sheets and can be cut to size with scissors or mounted with glass to screw onto lenses.  A well equipped photographich supply store should have them. <br>
<br>
see:<br>
http://www.kodak.com/cluster/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/f13/f13.pdf  It's about infrared film but includes the response data for these two filters.<br>
<br>
Or there's  Hoya IR80 and Schott RG830 glass filters.<br>
These will handle considerably more power and have a bit sharper cutoff.<br>
see<br>
http://www.newportglass.com/hir80.htm<br>
http://www.controloptics.com/catalog/5C/5C-40A.htm<br>
<br>
These are typically under $50 for a 2&quot; square. <br>
<br>
I see a lot of filters for sale for flashlights, but I'm not the person to ask about their specs.  Some are probably good but I don't know which.  <br>

All of a sudden I saw a very bright flash on the side of a deer.  Then I heard her say &quot;those deer are a 109 yards away&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Wow!  I knew that the NV worked in the IR ranges, but it kinda startled me at first.  We had a good laugh out of it.<br>
<br>
I have reframed from viewing the flash.  What is the chances of damage?   The duration of the laser is about a 1/2 sec and the laser is a rated class 1.  I think this is &lt; 5mW if memory serves me.......Thanks again  jh.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 15, 2002, 11:47 AM<BR> from IP address 207.179.194.95</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011124025'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>NV &amp; range finders</b><br>by

			<P></center>Most of the commercial rangefinders are readily visible with any generation of NV equipment.  I've tried Leica Geovid, Leica 800, Bushnell Scout and Bushnel 1000.<br>
<br>
The Geovid was the most visible, the 800 the least.  <br>
You can see the reflected beam with any of them to beyond their working limit with a Gen II or III scope. Unless you have them mounted together so that the spot always appears on the NV equipment at the same place on the screen and you use it a lot or you aim one directly into your NV scope you don't have anything to worry about.  <br>
<br>
Most military rangefinders are vastly more powerful than the commercial units and can cause damage with a single pulse if it's aimed into the NV scope. <br>

			<P></center>Of course the size of the beam from a laser rangefinder is mostly a matter of how it was adjusted at the factory.  My Geovid has a tighter beam then the Bushnells. It appears to be only about 1 MOA.  This may be surprising to but my $300 Bushnell 1000 outperforms my Geovid for maximum distance! The Geovid is a very early one though. Newer ones are no doubt better.  The binoculars of the Geovid are much better than the little telescope of the Bushnells.  The Bushnells are useless at night since you can't see the target or the non-illuminated liquid crystal display.  The scope on the Leica 800 isn't very good at night either, but you can read the LED display.  You can use a NV viewer to point a rangefinder at night even if you can't see your target through the small aiming scope.<br>

			<P></center>on that exact filter and use of the scope in daytime.   I personally would recommend use in the daytime only in shaded locations or overcast days, and only long enough to sight the weapon or test fire.   Extended use could cause shortening the life of the image tube/tubes and those are already at least 20 years old.  Leave the filter on all the time, except when using the sight at night, after dark,  or in a dark room without windows.  Did you get a manual with the sight?  Guessing probably not, as they are scarce it seems.   Nice sight though.  Very good example of US gen 1.  <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 15, 2002, 6:30 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.36</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011148254'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<br>
Do you want a copy of the PVS 502 manual too?<br>
<br>
I have been thinking about scanning it in and converting each page to a jpeg. That way you or anyone else on here who wants a copy can download it and print it out on their computer (or just view it on their screen).<br>
<br>
The copy I have is a &quot;copy of a copy&quot; and although the text is good, the photos are a bit washed out, but are still useable. Let me know if you want a copy (or anyone else reading this post), and I will scan it in when I get some free time.<br>

			<P></center>I have the manuel alright but all I could find about the filter (boresight filter) was on page 1-3 and I quote: &quot;It provides protection for the objective lens when the sight is not in use and permits the sight to be operated under daylight conditions.

Maybe I could restate my question this way late in the day when my normal rifle scope will nolonger bring in enough light for me to see I can (?) change to NV with filter then when It does not work take off the filter.

Anyhow, regarding Gen. 1 tube specs.  Particularly RUSSIAN Gen. 1 tube specs, let's tackle this issue.  It's not so much that the individuals who claim these things put a lot of light through their tubes.  Rather, it's WHICH light they put through their tubes.  Tubes are particularly sensitive to certain types of light (it actually depends on how the tube is made which one this is).  This wavelength of light may not exist in nature, but if it exists in your lab -- BOOM!  35,000 gain.<br>
<br>
Actually, 35,000 isn't the worst I've seen.  I once saw one that claimed 80,000!<br>

			<P></center>Some unscrupulous sellers may  state that the gain of a tube is the ratio of the light energy emitted by the phosphor to the light energy striking the photocathode.  That sounds reasonable, but if you use that as the definition you can call the gain anything you want. As you reduce the input toward zero the phosphor still glows from thermal emission and the &quot;gain&quot; heads toward infinity.   <br>

			<P></center>Both ITT and Litton (which is now Northrup Grumund) make the PVS-7 and 14. The 7 is the single tube goggle that is being used by the military. Uses the same principle as the ITT 222 though the 222 is the very &quot;commercialized&quot; verson. The 14 is a single tube monogoggle. Both can be seen on the US night vision page. The only real big difference in the 222 and 7b are personal taste, the choice of tubes, and of course the price. The 222 is an excellant choice especially if you are new to night vision ITT and Litton are the only producers of gen3 tubes and they are of course the best. If you want to get a hold of Lanny or Rich just post a message and put their name in the message title box. They will respond promptly.

How much in $$ is a good ITT(222) or Litton (PVS 7) spec going to change the price as opposed to one with poor specs?  Will a ITT 222 night quest from cabela's come with poor specs?

			<P></center>Cabela's usually sells good stuff in the first place. All of the tubes in the 222 are probably a standard OMNI 3 45lp/mm commercial tube. Tubes are rated on their resolution and the amount of cosmetic blemishes on the tube. Since your new to all of this stuff the 45 lp/mm (line pairs per millimeter) is the amount on resolution on a tube. Cosmetic blemishes are those little black spots on the tube. They are rated by the amount of blemishes in certain grids of the tube screen. ITT just recently sent a letter to dealers saying that all of their tubes including the 222 model are now 51 lp/mm as apposed to the 45 (not much of a big difference). With price i would surf the net and check out some dealers and their prices. I have found that with the commercial units by ITT the prices are always the same from dealer to dealer but be weary of prices that are to good to be true. Make sure you get the 2 year warranty because all new gen 3 ITT stuff comes with a two year warranty. As for the PVS-7b it as I said earlier has some of the same features as the 222 but I think the 7b has a better headmount and is more suited for headmount use. The 7b's usually come in three types of tubes the OMNI 3 and 4 in 45,51,and 64 lp/mm ;the 64 is reffered to as the D or &quot;delta&quot; tube. Prices range from 2,700 to 4,300. I found the 45 lp/mm tube to be more than good enough.

			<P></center>I have a question regarding the symptom of a bright emmission of light blooming forth from the top corner of the phosphor screen, and question whether or not it may have originated from my assembly techniques... If nothing else, the following experience has led to my interest in NV.<br>
 <br>
One cold Winter night, About 7 or 8 years ago, I was lying in bed suffering from insomnia, reading a copy of 'Popular Electronics', when I came across an advertisment entitled &quot;Build Your Own Night Vision&quot;.  Seeing that the company was located in Australia (I think it was Oakley electronics), and I was wide awake at 4 AM, I ordered what turned out to be a used three stage US Gen 1 tube assembly, and a handfull of high voltage diodes and capacitors for making a 18 kV power supply.  I assembled the components, mounting the tube in a 3 inch PVC pipe, with lenses etc., and mounting the power supply below.  I used high voltage rated wire from the power supply to each tube.  Since I saw no good way to solder onto the metal contact bands around the tube, I wire wrapped the cathode and anode connections, and taped over each with PVC. (I figure that to be the most likly place for a problem).  Are there other possible causes for this type of emmission?  One interesting thing to take note of was that the emission stops when the power is cut off, before the tube slowly dims to off. Otherwise, the output is very bright and clear, and seems much more responsive in comparison to Russian Gen 1, from my experience.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 14, 2002, 6:43 PM<BR> from IP address 162.83.202.232</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011062600'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>HV</b><br>by

			<P></center>I  am not sure exactly what the hv should be, it is varied from stage to stage of course,  and I am sure there is at least one person on the forum who can help in that regard, but I think the HV on those is less than 18kv at the highest point.  That could be the problem.  Also what did you use for an insulating potting material?<br>

			<P></center>Regarding potting the power supply components, I used silicon rubber as the potting material.<br>
Regarding potting the tube, I used foamed polyethylene, which I cut into small semicircles, to hold the tube solidly in place within the PVC pipe, with air as the primary dielectric.  I know it ain't nitrogen, but it was the best I could do.<br>
I thought about the voltage also, and subsequently tried varying the normal 9 volt input from 7 to 10 volts, (which should vary the output) but still had the same emission problem.  I've always wondered if it might be the wire wrap connections, but at such high voltage, I would think that a decent physical connection would be OK without soldering directly to the tube, and risking cracking it.<br>

			<P></center>Yes, at the time of assembly the tubes each had two steel bands, (cathode and anode).  All three tubes were well cemented together as one unit, about a foot long total, and relativly heavy, as I remember.<br>
In regard to measuring the voltage to each stage, even if I opened up the assembly, I do not have a meter that will read over 1000 V, so that will always be a mystery.<br>
Of course it is possible that one of the tubes is &quot;going South&quot;, but like I said, it was my first NV, and served to show me how interesting this stuff is.

			<P></center>I can only think of two possible causes to the &quot;light blooming&quot; problem you describe. One would be very easy to rule in or out. It is if the high voltage tube connection is near where you are seeing this &quot;light bloom&quot;, the tube is probably picking up the corona discharge from the HV terminal. You have to keep in mind though that this point could be inverted through the image intensifiers.<br>
<br>
The best fix for this is to go to a TV repair shop or an electronics parts supply store and buy a bottle of corona dope. It's like a thick browny-red nail polish, and is used to stop corona leaks around the HV components in TV's or video monitors. Paint all metal parts of the tubes that are at HV potential. If you get any on areas you don't want, it will clean up easily before it dries with alcohol. This stuff will stop all HV corona emissions better than RTV silicone, because it coats better, and traps no air pockets or channels where HV can worm it's way out of.<br>
<br>
The other thing that could be causing the problem is you might have a slightly flakey tube in the stack and be a little over voltage with your HV supply. I have seen the problem myself when I used to build gen 0 IR viewers 20 years ago. It's like once you exceed a certain point in HV, there will be a constant electron flow (break down) inside the tube, and this will cause a spot to be lit up on the output window. I used to just keep adding 1 meg ohm 1/8 watt resistors in series with the HV feed until the tube settled down. I just used the ordinary common resistors you get at Radio Shack, and not the fancy expensive HV ones and they worked fine. I suspect that you may just have too much HV, since the problem clears itself up as soon as you kill the juice and the excessive electron flow in the flakey tube stops instantly. It was probably this that caused the stack you have to be pulled and surplused in the first place. <br>
<br>
Good luck with your project,<br>

It seems I'm going to have to crack open the case and rebuild this thing pretty much all the way.  I do have a bunch of HV resistors in my 'junk box' that I used to use on HeNe lasers, so I guess I can start from there.<br>
By the way, there is often a faint but audible 'sizzle and pop' sound that directly accompanies the visuals, making me think there is arcing somewhere.

			<P></center>When light strikes the photocathode of an intensifier electrons are freed from the surface.  At a given wavelength light has a minimum energy with which it can interact with an electron.  That energy is called a photon. It has no rest mass. It's not like a little billiard ball as it has wave properties too.  Even though it has enough energy, each photon does not necessarily knock loose one photon.  Over a range of wavelength which a photocathode is sensitive it can be rated as to it's quantum efficiency.  S20 cathodes for example have a peak quantum efficiency of around 25 percent in the blue-green falling smoothly to near zero around 1100nm, well into the IR.  A GaAs photocathode has 40 to 50% QE which is fairly constant out to 950nm where it then falls rapidly.  For the s20 that doesn't mean it takes 4 photons to knock loose one electron, only that about 1 in four succeed in doing it.  Some CCDs have QE's of over 90% at some wavelengths, and if exposed to shortwave UV or Xrays some detectors can have more than one electron released by a single photon giving a QE of over 100 percent.  <br>
<br>
Electrons are also released just by the thermal vibration of the photocathode molecules. At room temperature thats most of the the weak grainy and &quot;crawly&quot; looking background noise you see when you look at a high quality tube in complete darkeness. That can be reduced by cooling the tube, but NV equipment is designed so it's not bothersome. GaAs has a little less thermal noise than S20. There are materials better than GaAs for low noise but they don't have the good infrared response.<br>
<br>
With an old tube there may be some gas in the tube and the gas ions hitting the cathode or multiplier channels can release electrons.  That's what causes most of the brighter sparkles you see in old tubes as each collision can release a number of electrons.    <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 14, 2002, 12:56 PM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1011041765'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>If I am hearing you right, you are saying to not worry about my batteries on my PVS14 until I get a low battery light, Is that right?<br>
My NV is still pretty new to me so I have not experience the low battery light yet. It really seems to have a long life though. I am not sure where exactly the battery low indicator will show up since it has not happened to me yet, but I am assuming it will be obvious when it does. Until then I will assume that my NV is working close to 90 or 100 percent.<br>

			<P></center>If you really want a red screen night vision device you could use a monochrome CCD camera with an IR illuminator coupled to a color LCD display.  It wouldn't cost much more than a Gen I and would work about as well. Cameras made with Sony  &quot;HAD Exview&quot; CCDs have good sensitivity and extend well into the IR. Reasonable prices too.  <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 13, 2002, 4:47 PM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010969240'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>He is looking for red phosphor output windows because he is building a multi-stage (multi-tube) device, and believes tubes are more sensitive to red as opposed to the green output of the tube in front of the next in his stack (the red is for tube to tube performance boost). At least that is what his question inferred to me?<br>
<br>
I don't know myself if this would give more gain or not, but if it does, I would still use a green phosphor output tube on the last tube in the stack because like you say, the human eye is more sensitive to green, and red phosphor output windowed tubes in the first two tubes (assuming he would be using a three tube gen 1 stack).<br>
<br>
You would think the military NV developers would have done this in the first place, unless red phosphor was not available in the 1970's.<br>

			<P></center>I considered that that but it didn't make sense to me.  The only intensifiers which are red sensitive only (without good green sensitivity)  are the Gen III's with GaAs photocathodes which are filtered specifically not to have visible sensitivity.  Inherently a Gen III tube's spectral reponse is quite flat from about 330nm (near ultraviolet and limited by the glass window) to about 950 nm (near infrared and limited by the nature of GaAs). To not have green sensitivity something has to be added to block it. GaAs is use because it has the best quantum efficiency in the near IR of any practical photoemissive material.   Some (most?) military Gen III intensifiers are blocked from yellow through ultraviolet. I'm not sure of all the reasons for doing that, no doubt for some performance improvement in military conditions.  The spectral range specs on a particular tube show if it's blocked. <br>
 <br>
Gen II and III intensifiers already have as much gain as is practical to use.  When simply increasing the voltage a little brings the cathode thermal noise up to the point where the phosphor glows adding another tube would just give a bright screen from the first tube's thermal noise.  A gen I or gen II tube (S20 response) has it's peak sensitivity in the mid visible anyway (green).    <br>
<br>
It might be possible to use two stages of intensifcation and get some benefit if the first stage could be made to have very low noise. With GaAs or S20 multialkali that means cryogenic cooling in the order of -40 to -80 degrees C.   You can get that from  multistage thermoelectric cooling or mechanical refigeration.  Even then the gain available in a single tube by increasing the voltage would probably be sufficient.  Intensifiers used in astronomy were typically cooled.  They aren't commonly used any more since thinned rear illuminated CCDS have lower noise, better quantum efficiency, less geometric distortion, better linearity and wider spectral response.  The parameter where intensifiers are better is response time.  That sort of a CCD however would not be very practical for an NV scope and it would resemble a thermal view (in complexity) if one were used.<br>
<br>
Another problem is that except for the Gen1's made specifically for the purpose, few intensifiers can be physically stacked because they don't have flat fiber optic anode and cathode windows which can be put in direct physical contact.  To use lens coupling either results in inefficient coupling or an very expensive lens. The use of lenses will make a very bulky assembly. <br>
<br>
Anyway, a few red phosphored intensifiers may have been build as experiments, perhaps to see if it would help preserve dark adaptation for the user. I'd be surprised if designers haven't tried it. To my knowledge though none are commonly manufactured or available, at least I've never seen one in manufactures spec sheets.  To have one custom made would be extremely expensive. <br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>red filter on green NV output...</b><br>by RJ<P></center>I have tried using a red filter with my gen 3 NV monocular. I found the red filter did indeed reduce the amount of time the NV viewing eye needed to recover for normal, unassisted night viewing. <br>
<br>
However, the range of  contrast was greatly reduced with the red filter in place. I found I could not see as well with the red filter. Although part of it had to do with overall reduced brightness, it was more a matter of reduced clarity.<br>
<br>
I also tried many other color filters. I did find a light sky blue filter made the green NV output appear more like a black &amp; white image. However, I did not spend enough time comparing the sky blue filter versus the unfilter NV output, to be able to say if the filter view suffered.<br>

You could adjust the beam to a spotlight and light up my cows at 150+ yards or widen the beam and it would not blind you at 10ft.This was perfect for a head mounted NV system on a dark night. It's just like using a invisable flash light walking around in the dark.I have a dedal 25 hand held IR but its to bright up close and still does not have the long range as the scorpin. It also is visable  when in use .It glows red which in a war would get you shoot real fast.

			<P></center>  Having just acquired my Gen 3 monocular within the past couple of weeks -- and being delighted with it -- I have decided to keep some of my Gen 1 stuff, too and wanted to share some of my thoughts.<br>
a.) I can now look at my Gen 1 as &quot;sacrificial&quot; and am willing to take it into environments, such as salt water marshes, where I'd never dream of risking the expensive (non waterproof) monocular. My boat or canoe invariably gets some water in it -- if only splashes -- and there's always the possibility of falling into a mud hole, capsizing, etc. Worrying too much about expensive equipment detracts from the enjoyment of a trip.<br>
b.) Despite the comparatively poor Gen 1 performance, I find that under IR illumination, animal eyes glow more brilliantly through Gen 1 than Gen 3. There are trade-offs in any technology and one learns to make the most of any device's idiosyncracies.<br>
c.) In terms of absolute performance, Gen 1 and 3 aren't anywhere close to being in the same league, yet Gen 1 is still infinitely better than no NV at all and is worth keeping as a spare.<br>
<br>

  I LOVE the Gen 3 monocular and thank you again for the deal. I'm sure you realize nothing in my previous post suggested otherwise. Only 5 or 6 times the cost for a submersible version, eh? OK, I'll take you up on it, but understand that I'll have to pay for the resulting divorce and child custody battle first... LOL.<br>
  I just posted some of my thoughts after reflecting that it took me over three years from the time I acquired my first Gen 1 scope to find the right deal (courtesy of yourself) and resources to get the Gen 3.  Through that period, I still had a great deal of useful enjoyment with Gen 1. Some guys reading certain posts in the forum (and no, I'm not pointing fingers or starting a flame war) might get the idea that Gen 1 is so inferior that they might as well not waste their time with NV unless they can afford the latest high $$$ wonder. I think that's an erroneous perspective; in most fields of interest, newcomers tend to start with less expensive equipment and move up as their interests grow.<br>
  If I may draw a photographic analogy, virtually all owners of high end cameras started with a little point and shoot, instamatic or maybe even an old Kodak Brownie. If these el-cheapo cameras had never been available, the sales of expensive cameras would be far, far smaller -- and even more expensive -- than they are now. The wide availability of cheap Gen 1 NV is probably the best thing that could have happened to <br>
the night vision industry and will ensure growing public interest for decades to come!<br>

			<P></center>The mounting base (also called a rail) stays with the rifle.  By having quick release mounts on both the NV scope and a conventional optical scope (or the rear metallic sights) you can switch back and forth without compromising the zero adjustments of either.  You won't win benchrest matches doing that but 1 MOA repeatability is normal for good quality mounts.<br>
Note the mention in the ad of &quot;weaver style mounts&quot;. <br>
A weaver base has a cross section sort of like:<br>
 ____<br>
&lt;____&gt;<br>
Which the mount clamps around. <br>

			<P></center>I have not actually seen it yet,  hope to soon,  but I believe what would be left is the forward portion of the sight mounted to the weapon.   It would be the objective, housing, mount, and reticle, but would not have an ocular.  It may actually be possible to come up with an ocular that would mount into the body of the sight once the NV monocular is removed,  thus giving you day/night sighting.  That might be something to address to Chris, or he will probably check out your post and answer that. I will also ask him about it.  That would make a nice little 24/7 weapon sight then.  <br>

			<P></center>The Falcon weapon system daylight compatability was thought of, but for the ocular lens system that it needed to invert and focus  the image from the objective, it was just not all that practical.  Perhaps it will be looked at again,  but for now, if you pull off the monocular, you have an objective housing left.   However you do have a really nice versatile monocular!<br>

			<P></center>There have been lots of attempts at day/night weapon sights, unfortunately there are only 2 that I know of that are much good.  The Litton PVS-10 which costs around $14,000,   and the ITT F7201(I think that is the model) which uses a monocular type eyepiece on a good quality daylight scope at a price of around $5,000 or so.  It is just hard to make something with good daylight optics, and nighttime optics and changing optics, etc, etc, at a price we all want to see it at.  It will happen though,  actully could be happening even as we type.<br>

It was a bit pricey at £289 but as I was getting rid of the radios it didn't cost me that much.You also get 10 days to send it back in if you don't like it.<br>

I like my Helios, its robust(read heavy metal body)and with the built in IR light works ok if there's not enough ambient light.The zenit lens is only f2 though(a bit plasticky), and the body finish is a bit rough in places.<br>

			<P></center>is what I was saying,  in regard to the claim of 200yd visibility by the NV seller you noted.   I can see 200yards in starlight with my naked eyes,  but not much and not very well.  Guess we were all kinda having a go at the unspecified claim of 200yard visibility,  but not at you personally.  There are so many claims of all kinds of stuff,   and no one right now is policing these ads like they do other stuff.  I could advertise my stuff like: gen 1 monocular with 50mm 1X lens, 400lp/mm max, max gain 300,000, etc.  Whos is going to stop me, other than my own concience?<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 13, 2002, 2:32 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.152.156</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010961135'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

You figure the PAQ-4 retails for around $1100, the PEQ-5 is about $1000, and the flashlight would account for the remainder of the cost.  Despite the price, I'd still be interested in purchasing one if the unit is small and lightweight.  Of course, I'm assuming it will be a military/LEO only device, therefore off-limits to most of us.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 11, 2002, 2:16 PM<BR> from IP address 63.44.223.64</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010787398'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>An AN/PVS-5 is rated about 30 hours on a pair of AA cells.  It uses two MX9916 tubes.   A pair of AA alkaline (to give 3 volts) cells is rated about 1500 mahr depending on the brand.  Lithium &quot;coin&quot; cells come in a wide variety sizes and ratings.  The largest that's commonly available is the Panasonic CR2477 which costs under $3.00, is 1.00&quot; by 0.276&quot; thick and is rated 3.0V at 1000mahr.  One of those should give in excess of 30 hours operation with a single MX9916 tube.<br>
<br>
It might be of interest that I've come up with a way to use the CR2477 cell to fit in the standard BA-5576/U holder compartment of a PVS-4 or TVS-5.  It takes a different spring, a nylon washer, and a strip of 1 mil mylar. The BA-5576/U has a rating of 800mahr so the Panasonic cell gives about the same life.  The Panasonic cell may not meet the Mil Specs of 175 G acceleration, 50,000 ft altitude, and -20F to +130F operation which the BA-5567/U does.  The Panasonic cell is about half the size and weight of the BA-5567/U.  The conversion is a drop in requiring no machining and no modification of the scope's battery compartment.  The parts to make 3 units (with pieces left over) costs about $20 from McMaster.  The tools requireded are a pair of scissors, a pair of pliers, and under 5 minutes of time.<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested I'll give more complete details. I don't want to be in the business of making kits. I don't know if this method will work on the several other NV scopes which use the BA-5567U since I don't have access to them to them to try. <br>

			<P></center>I beleive Lou's idea would be a benefit to those of us which use PVS-7's and the top bulge of the battery compartment that holds the AA's is made for this battery also. I have 3 originals that work in mine and they store better than Alkaline I believe. I imagine that Lithium AA would be the next logical step but the cost is alot more than a buck a piece. Are there any other benefits to the smaller battery being used as proposed by Lou ? Great idea by the way Lou. I would like to see the details.<br>

			<P></center>Energizer sells a 1.5 volt AA lithium battery  which should be ok when used in pairs for NV use in place of Alkaline.  They claim they're the only company with a 1.5 volt lithium battery which may be true because normally the chemistry of a lithium cell gives 3 volts.  <br>
I don't know the details of how their battery works. <br>
<br>
 Unfortunately there are some manufactures who are selling the same size batteries and calling them AA which are 3 volt.  Tadiran in particular.  They will physically fit in your equpment but DONT USE THEM. as over twice the rated voltage is likely to smoke the power supply.  More voltage is not better!  You could use just one but you'd have to put a shorting bar in the other cell holder.  There are also AA nicad rechargables which are 1.2 volts.  They may work but considering how long a pair of alkalines run an intensifier I hardly see the point of using anything else if the scope is designed for AA cells. <br>
<br>
I've got the parts coming to use a CR2477 battery in a PVS-4.   I made one using parts I have around my shop which aren't quite identical.  When I make one with the commercial parts I'll post the details.  Should be only a few days.  <br>

			<P></center>  Here's a tip for the budget conscious: I just made a great little IR illuminator by pirating the IR diodes from an old TV remote control, and wiring to a switch and 3 volt battery. You need to check old remotes to find diodes which are really invisible to the naked eye. This one doesn't illuminate very brightly with my Gen 1 equipment, but is really great with my Gen 3 ANVIS monocular!<br>

Assuming it's a normal Gen 1 scope with an S20 multialkali photocathode and equal power levels 810nm light will be slightly more &quot;visible&quot; than 840.  I doubt most people would notice the difference. <br>
 <br>
Look at the web site I posted a few days ago when someone asked a similar question about Gen II vs Gen III.  Gen 1 and Gen II have about the same spectral curve, the gen II is just more sensitive because of it's microchannel multiplier.<br>

  I would assume that the 810 nm would be somewhat more visible to Russian Gen 1 scopes. IR television and VCR remotes are easily found for little or nothing at garage sales and places like Goodwill. My less-than-scientific experiments were nothing more than trying out a few remotes and finding diodes which I absolutely could not see with the naked eye in a dark room. Those are the ones I selected to make my illuminator. As I explained previously, it was not very bright as seen through my Gen 1 equipment, but worked very well on my Gen 3 monocular.<br>
  Though the IR illuminators built in to a lot of Gen 1 equipment might be fine for viewing wildlife, they are far, far too visible for any sort of covert work. Again, I have done field experiments with them and my 14 year-old son can see the illuminator source as a tiny red dot from nearly a block away if he is staring directly at it on a dark and moonless night. <br>
  Another interesting phenomenon was using some IR flashlight filters I bought on eBay a couple of years ago, when all I owned was Gen 1. They are &quot;deep&quot; IR filters and -- though invisible -- were very disappointing and hardly usable when viewed through Gen 1. Viewed through Gen 3, the filtered flashlight beam is now brilliant!<br>
  One other thing; if you make a homemade illuminator, make sure the polarity is correct. Diodes only pass current in one direction...<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>IR for Gen I</b><br>by Sid<P></center>My experience of illuminators with Gen I is that the more 'visible' the IR wavelength the better the viewing like Doc points out.<br>
<br>
All the Russian units I have seen or used ( with one exception ) have given out a dull red glow which I guess puts them at around 750nm.<br>
The exception is the Aries MK-258 I recently got my hands on, which has quite a nice illuminator. It's not visible ( to me anyway ) but is actually of some use at my airgun hunting ranges of 30-40 yards. I wish I could identify the LED used because an array of them would be just the ticket....<br>
<br>
You might think that a civilian hunter wouldn't have to worry about being 'covert', but here in the UK we have some very, very, wary varmints. I spooked a wascally wabbit the other night with a home made illuminator that was filtered down to a dull red glow.<br>
Wouldn't have believed it possible and has given me a new interest in the less visible parts of the IR spectrum.....<br>

			<P></center>Your discription doesn't seem adequate to pin down the specific battery.  If you could give the exact dimensions (diameter and length) to 0.01&quot; and a description of the terminals it would help.  A photo would be better.<br>
 <br>
A list of various batteries used in assorted pieces of military equpment can be found at :<br>
http://www.pacificsites.com/~brooke/TS183.shtml<br>
It's a list for the TS-183B/U battery test set.<br>
<br>
Lithium batteries were developed around 1963, but NiCad, Alkaline, and Silver Oxide were just a few years earlier.  It could even be a mercury battery.  Chances are you can't get an exact replacement but if the voltage, size, and polarity can be determined it should be possible to make an adapter for a currently available battery.  Probably even one which mounts in the original holder.<br>

The cells are a plastic tube with brass caps and inside are hundreds of thin wafers with platinum or similar on one side, some black powderlike manganese or something on the other.   I picked these 2 substances from a list of materials used for HV power cells in an old ref. book.   They could be any of sever combinations,  but there has to be some sort of electolyte or catalyst to activate the reaction and generate the voltage,  and I cannot find any information other than it could be some kind of saline, costic soda, or something like that. They are dry now.

			<P></center>I didn't see your post, but if you need a 4.5KV power supply I'd look to getting a converter, not trying to make a new battery.  If you're just into restorations I suppose you could go to the effort of manufacturing a 1 up battery but I sure wouldn't try. There are some pretty thin lithium batteries and they're 3v each but that's still 1500 cells to get 4.5kv.  For that money you can buy a decent Gen III.<br>
<br>
Companies like Pico and Venus make fairly small high voltage power supplies.  I'm skepical its worth the effort to bring any gen 0 unit back to life unless its for it's historic value and then using substitutes isn't correct.  Sometimes it better to let an old dog die than to try to revive it.<br>
<br>
Does it use a 1P25 tube?  I built my first &quot;night vision&quot; scope in about 1960 using one of those.  Then you could buy them &quot;new surplus&quot; for $5. I used a small neon sign transformer and TV rectifier (1B3 if I remember) for the 5kv supply.  I had a 150 watt cesium gas discharge illuminator with a glass IR filter for it. It was a monstrosity, but I could see two hundred yards in the dark with it.<br>
<br>
Ah childhood memories....<br>

			<P></center>This dates back into the 40's  according to the paperwork with it.  I saw one like it somewhere else once.   I don't know the tube number,  I could go and get it down in the basement lab.   It is a &quot;square&quot; clear cylinder with a very coarse phosphor screen, and a very thin photocathode.  It has some metalic diode looking parts inside connecting the grid to the screen, uses the metal case for the ground, and a clip contacts the outer ring of the PC, the 3 batteries and 2 lenses.   The objective is metalic filmed rather than the input window like some of the other gen 0 tubes I have seen.  It is all sealed in a metal can wrapped with canvas.  The can is soldered so there is really no repair other than serious in shop stuff.

			<P></center>I don't see that model listed on the Laserex web site but my impression is they have quality products. <br>
That power and wavelength should be useful with any generation of IR viewer. Most useful with the ones which have magnification.   If the module has adjustable focus (most of their modules appear to be built that way)  you should be able to open up the spot to a few meters across at the target to give useful (and fairly safe) long range illumination. If you want broad illumination (over a 5 degree wide beam) you'd probably  be better off with a filtered flashlight or spotlight as you can get more power for less money.  It just won't focus as well.   I'd think it would be a useful illuminator with gen II to around 500 meters  or Gen III to 1000.  As a pointer (adjusted for best collimation) it will be visible a few kilometers with either.  <br>
<br>
When focused or at close range a 40mw IR laser is not eyesafe so be careful. Unlike a visible laser it won't trigger your aversion reflex to protect your eye and probably won't even be painful.  If you do get get damage it won't be instant blindness. Just light or dark spots or lines in your vision which don't go away and perhaps headaches.   <br>
<br>
Only you can evaluate whether it's useful.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 9, 2002, 10:56 AM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010602602'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Sorry,  I did find one piece of literature,  but it was referring to the Moonwalker 1,  and that is a gen 1 &quot;Russian&quot; pocket scope.   So the 3 may be either an upgraded gen 1,  or another generation. Sorry,  both places that I had it listed from are long out of business.  <br>
If you are thinking of buying it, get a return guarantee from the seller if possible.  Depending on what he wants,  you are most often better off going with something new, unless the price is really right and you can see it first.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Gen Super I+ is REAL</b><br>by takatuka san<P></center>This is a further development of the Gen I NV tube with a fiber optics plate being installed at the front or an exit of a tube. This modification allows for a dramatic improvement of the image resolution and prevents distortion from other light sources in a field of view. Tubes of Gen I+ have light amplification of appr. 1000 times, while the photo cathode sensitivity increases to min. 280 µA/lm. Resolution in the center is min 45 lp/mm.<br>
<br>
Night vision units built with the Gen I+ tubes differ from the Gen I night vision units by increased image quality, lower distortions and better viewing distance in passive or active mode (with or without an IR illuminator). These scopes work well in an urban environment. In the open, the units are effective with the ambient light levels down to ¼ of a moon. When light conditions are lower, an IR illuminator is needed. The cost of the Gen I+ tubes is 4-9 times of the cost of regular Gen I. Our company manufactures the Dedal 220 and Dedal 200 using the Gen I+ tubes.<br>

			<P></center>Those specs don't sound much different than a decent gen 1.   I can see where the correcting fiber optics could help clear up some of the distortion caused by the electrostatic inverting tube,  but don't see where that would be a help to resolution in anyway. Good gen 1 tubes have always had high center resolution figures.   Just seems like a new method of advertising to boost sales, like people advertising gen 3+ when what they are talking about is a 51lp tube compared to a 45lp tube.  Got any specific tube data comparisons you can post for a recent gen 1 compared to a &quot;gen 1+&quot;?<br>

			<P></center>It can be done,  though to be done properly it would not be inexpensive.  The MX10160 fits pretty well into the housing with a spacer tube,  then you need to make some slide contacts, or hard wire the tubes.  To start with you need to find a really closely matched set of these tubes,  so you would need to either order a new nearly matched set, or find someone who can test them for some of the more noticeable characteristics.  Otherwise you would not be comfortable using them, say one bright, one with noise, etc.  This alone would be the costly part.   There have been a few sets made,  but I never saw them to know how well they worked.   The tube fitting itself is not a big deal,  and it would make a superb goggle.   Of course &quot;someone&quot; might say that the coating on the optics was designed for gen 2, as they said about the PVS-4, but I doubt you would notice that over the massive improvement in viewing!!  Check with Chris,  perhaps John over at USNV would do it for you.  Probably would only cost several thousand.  Good anvis tubes do not come inexpensively.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 7, 2002, 4:38 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.39</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010450287'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<br>
 if the NV unit is OFF and the cover is removed in DAYLIGHT does this cause problems?<br>

			<P></center>Hi Scott,<br>
<br>
That's a good question, I'm no expert on it, but you would think it would be OK if in the house out of direct sunlight, and only for a short period of time.<br>
<br>
Years ago when I was experimenting with amateur radio television, I had a black and white video camera that used the vidicon electronic tube as opposed to the CCD imagers the modern cameras us now. I had it in my work shop sitting on a shelf for a while with the lens cover off, and the lens was pointing towards a light on the ceiling of my shop. Anyway to make a long story short, I got a new camera and gave the old one to a ham buddy of mine, and when we tried it out in my shop to see if it still worked, it had an image of the light permanently burned into the tube. I know this can happen when a camera is on, but I was very surprised to see it can happen with the camera off as well. With night vision tubes having the most sensitive photo cathodes of any electronic devices todate, I would err on the side of safety, and keep it always covered. I won't even use a flash on a camera when taking pictures of NV gear, as I'm worried about damaging the tubes.<br>

the only reason i ask is because of those regular cleanings the objective lens gets after a night of shooting prone on the desert floor.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 7, 2002, 12:32 PM<BR> from IP address 63.50.230.31</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010435549'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Bright light on the photocathode of an intensifier can damage the cathode with the tube on or off.  It can damage the phosphor on the output size only with the tube powered.  Damage to the cathode can take place almost instantaniously with direct sunlight, laser pulse, flash bulb or strobe.  Such damage can leave a dark or light spot or possible kill the tube completely.  Damage to the phosphor is almost always just the dimming of an area.  Sweeping the view across a light will sometimes leave a &quot;trail&quot; but that's usually temporary.  Leaving an intensifier looking at a moderately bright night scene, such a fixed intensifier on a camera in a warehouse will eventually &quot;burn in&quot; the image on the cathode.  That could take days or weeks.  As a good rule of thumb, don't look a anything with your intensifier that gives a spot bright enough to &quot;bloom&quot; at all. By bloom I mean that the image will be larger on the phosphor than it would be if it were dimmer.   Don't look at any light source for an extended period of time. <br>
<br>
It's mostly just common sense.  You can clean your equipment in a moderately illuminated room but I'd be careful not to point the objective directly at a lightbulb.  Don't be too anxious to remove the dust.  Careless cleaning is much more damaging to optics than leaving the dust on them.  Wiping dusty optics with a clean cloth or lens paper is about the worst thing you can do.  Proper cleaning of optics warrants a separate discussion.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 7, 2002, 2:25 PM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010442357'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>thanks for the run down on the photocathode sensitivity. <br>
<br>
now on to cleaning. when i recieved my raptor it came with lens paper (which i never use) and a paint brush! this i use to lightly dust off the objective lens. i also have one of those new &quot;LENS PENS&quot; that came with my Trijicon scope. have you seen these? they have a brush on one end and some sort of cleaning tip on the other. i have used this on my day scope with no ill effect ,yet. i have not tried it on the night scope as i think they have special lens coatings(?) and am not sure if it will damage it.<br>

			<P></center>First and most obvious although often ignored is to not get the optics dirty in the first place. At least no more than necessary.   That means:<br>
<br>
Keep lenses covered when not in use.<br>
Keep out of rain/snow/blowing dust when possible.<br>
Prevent condensing moisture which will desolve dust and stick it to the lenses. Dust sitting on a lens generally won't hurt it or the coatings, but if it's disolved in water some dust may be alkaline or acidic and etch the surfaces.  Moisture with dust left on optical surfaces for an extended period of time does more damage to optics than anything else.  Avoid pollen which isn't just dusty but also oily and sticky.  Don't touch optics with your to prevent body oil from getting on the lenses. Eyelashes on eyepieces are a common problem.<br>
<br>
The idea of cleaning is to remove unwanted material without harming the surfaces.  Most optical surfaces are fairly hard, but a lot of the particles in dust are even harder.  Most material which you'll find on lenses other than dust is organic based.  It will usually be soluable in water, alcohol, or acetone.  Glass and coated optics won't be harmed by those but they can spread oils around without removing them.  Acetone can ruin plastics.<br>
<br>
You need to know the optical material to know if they can stand the solvents.  Usually its not the lenses that's the problem, it's the housings and seals.  Most military optics can be cleaned with soapy water without damage. <br>
<br>
Here's the process I use on my telescope mirors and other external optical surfaces of my astronomical telescopes.  These are typically  $30,000 pieces of precision low expansion glass with aluminized and SiO overcoated surfaces.  They are at least as delicate as typical NV optics.  These mirrors have to sit out all night every reasonably clear night and they get dirty from whatever is in the air which settles on them.  I clean them about every two months, or when their reflectivity drops by 5%.  Cleaning more often than necessary is just causes excess wear.  <br>
<br>
The process is to first flood them with a weak solvent and water.  I use a mix of 10% windex (yep, common grocery store windex) and 90% distilled water.  The surface doesn't get blasted. just a gentle &quot;rain&quot; from a spray bottle.  I set the optics so they face down and spray upward.  THat way the dirt ladened water falls from the glass rather than sliding over it. This spraying  goes on for a couple of minutes giving stuck particles time to disolve. Then I spray the surface with distilled water only, let most of that drain off then blow it dry with a stream of air filtered to be free from oil, dust, or water. The idea is to knock the water off rather than letting it evaporate.    I then inspect the mirror carefully for anything which didn't wash off.  If there are spots from insect or bird droppings I may attempt to remove that with  more water or use alcohol, or acetone. On rare occasons I'll use a small soft brush plus plenty of water to wash away any residue but I'm caredful not to touch any of the mirror with the brush that isn't contaminated already.  It can only do more damage.  Ocasonally something will actually damage a spot on the surface.  It's best to just leave those alone since the damage is already done. Some of the mirrors have been in continuous use for over 20 years and still don't need recoating. Optics which have damaged coatings can be stripped and recoated if the glass underneath hasn't been damaged. It's not cheap since it requires a vacuum chamber and special equipment to monitor the coating thickensses. The coatings aren't easy to remove either. <br>
<br>
Water is the best universal solvent and its cheap enough to use in large quantities.  Acetone is my second favorie as it is very pure by the nature of the way it's manufactured, is great at desolving oil and grease.  When it evaporates though whatever is suspended in it doesn't evaporate, so you have to actually wash the acetone with the grease or oil away rather than letting it evaporate.  Acetone and water mix.  Alcohol will desolve a few things that water or acetone don't, but I find it's more likely to leave a residue than water or acetone.   <br>
<br>
I don't like to blow dust off of mirrors or lenses with air or bottled freon.  For just the light dust found in a house its ok if done gently, but for the &quot;desert sand&quot; kind of dust it can just be a form of sandblasting.  I find liquids are gentler. Some  observatories use CO2 to clean large mirrors.  It's about the only thing which works well on bare aluminum mirrors with no coatings.  The method is to aim a stream of liquid CO2 from a tank at the mirror and let the point where it changes to the gas phase just contact the surface.  The rapidly expansion of the &quot;boiling&quot; CO2 lifts the dirt particles away from the mirror with little tendancy to drive the particles against the surface.  <br>
<br>
I cringe every time I see lens paper.  It can be used after dust has been removed to remove oils, particularly by soaking it with a solvent and lightly draging it across the optical surface,  but too many people use it to wipe away dust.  You might as well use a piece of sandpaper.  Lens brushes aren't so bad if used gently.  Don't touch the brush as it can lay down body oil like a paintbrush.  <br>
<br>
To really clean optics well, partecularly internal surfaces, requires a clean enviroment.  Just because you see a couple of pieces of dust beind the lens or you NV scope avoid the temptation to remove it.  Think about the surface area of the dust particles compared to the area of the lens.  You can live just fine with some dust particles.  On the other hand if you mess up the coatings you may lose several  percent of the light even if the surface is dust free. <br>

ALWAYS check the label first. We use a solution called DUPENOL (sp)it is basicallyh just a soap and water mix. A few drops of good kitchen liquid soap,Check label, in a pint of water will do for almost everything.Never rub the optics. Cleaning should always be done in a circular motion starting from the center and working out to the edge, in this manner you wipe the dirt out to the edge and then it can be lifted off.

			<P></center>The photocathode is basically a semiconductor that reacts to light(this is not too much of an exact scientific answer) whether it is powered or not.  The material itself gives off electrons when exposed to light,  period.  On or off,  bright light will cause an over release of electrons and cause &quot;burns&quot; or depleted spots.  Best to keep the cathode or objective lens covered in the daytime,  or at least avoid direct strong light sources.  <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 7, 2002, 2:44 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.39</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010443499'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

The goggles are really quite robust, I just dont see how you can really damage one if you just use some common sense, treat it like you would a 35MM camera and I dont think it would ever give anyone any trouble.<br>

			<P></center>That is what I figured.  Though the cathode would react to any light(wouldn't it)  it would not necessarily overreact or try and give off more electrons than the material could handle unless it was under sustained bright light or if oxygen was present to cause burning??

			<P></center>The problem isn't the photocathode not having enough electrons to give up.  It's that bright light and heat can damage the microscopicly thin photocathode material.  It can change the molecular struture of either the multialkalai cathode of gen 1 or II or the galium arsinide cathode of a gen III.  There are many materials which if you leave them in sunlight they will deteriorate and if you focus the sun on them with a large magnifier they'll be damaged almost instananeously. For most common objects the deterioration of a tiny amount of surface material doesn't matter.  For an image tube cathode that's all there is.   <br>
<br>
The phosphors on NV equipment deteriorate primarily from the bombardment of electrons.  The rate of electron impact times the time determines the total loss of sensitivity with time.  There are 8760 hours in a year and most gen III tubes are rated for 10,000 hours of normal use. But a few minutes of all the energy the tubes power supply can deliver beating on a small spot is enough to cause similar deterioration. The latter will be more annoying because it will be a spot on the image rather than a uniform dimming of the whole image. That why having a laser pointer attached to a weapon so the bright spot is always in one place is bad for the tubes. <br>
<br>
Sunlight can damage the phosphors if it's allowed to shine in the eyepiece end of NV equipment since the eyepiece will focus the sun to a tiny hot spot on the phosphor. <br>
<br>
Without the optics in place intensifier tubes are less likely to be damaged by bright lights than after they're installed in the equipment.  Chris's statement about letting them sit under room light during assembly isn't surprising.   I use both GaAs and S20e photomultipliers in my  telesocopes. Their photocathodes are similar to those in intensifiers. They can be handled in normal room lighting with no problem.  They take a few hours to recover once their put in service in low light conditions but no permanent damage occurs even if they're exposed briefly to the daytime sky. I'd never let direct sunlight, even unfocused, fall on them. <br>

			<P></center>I found a pair of swiss military binocs, and they are PVS-7 style (two eyepieces, one tube).  They have a very large IR spotlight that slides onto the top of the unit.  This exact unit is in Janes Infantry Weapons, but I don't remember the name of the unit, or the Generation.  I thought is would be Gen 0, because of the IR spot, but this is the reply I received from the owner. Can someone help me with some info on this, what gen it is, is it a nice unit, etc??<br>
<br>
It is very well made.  Here is the response:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have received several inquiries and this response is generic, but<br>
addresses all of the questions.<br>
<br>
This Night Vision is Fully Operational.<br>
<br>
I am having difficulty getting a clear definition of exactly which<br>
generation this night vision is.  The Swiss still have it as Classified and<br>
Old Delft says to ask the Swiss.<br>
<br>
It is not Gen 0 or Gen 1.  It uses Gallium Arsenide material for light<br>
amplification.  It does function without the IR Illuminator and has &quot;boost&quot;<br>
buttons for each eyepiece (L&amp;R).  I think that it is most likely a Gen 2 or<br>
possibly an early Gen 3.<br>
<br>
In the photos you see that it has a Lens Cap on it.  THIS MUST NOT BE<br>
REMOVED EXCEPT IN EXTREME LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS!!!  If you do remove it, you<br>
can overload the compounds used for light amplification and must wait<br>
several hours for them to stabilize.  Fortunately, a spare compound insert<br>
is included with each Night Vision Kit.<br>
<br>
I hope that this helps.<br>
<br>
All the best!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Does someone recognize the unit?<br>
thanks!!<br>
Jason.<br>

			<P></center>at the same thing,  on ebay there is one, and the guy has a few more.  From all the description and the manual's description,  it sounded like a nice gen 1,  but he sent a photo of what he said was the tube,   and if that is what it was, it is a gen 0,  though it is supposed to have decent resolution according to the manual.  I am currently checking with a guy in Europe to see if he knows the unit.  I will get back to you.  They sure look nice,  huge, but nice.<br>

 <br>
Price is approx $500 here in Europe, Because its better the the russian stuff and not as impossible to get as the US items. <br>
I would imagen the it comes from  the Gulf war.<br>
 <br>
.......that was a paste from his email,  they are quite heavy,  unlike the PVS-7 which is about a quarter the weight.   Not sure what the deal with the vision in left ocular is about.  I will try to clarify that.   Also what the guy sent me as a photo of the image intensifier does not fit that description, but I think the seller may have been mistaken,  as what he showed me looked more like an eyepiece cell or something.<br>

So I guess the designer looks at what wavelengths a 'threat' laser is likely to be operating at and arranges it so that this is where the filter works.<br>
<br>
If you have any experience of audio or radio theory then I can best explain it as being a 'bandstop' filter.<br>
<br>
I suppose the trade off comes between blocking all possible 'threats' and still allowing the NVD to be useful to the user.<br>
<br>
I know an optical firm who offer LIF's but the impression I got was that 'if you have to ask how much it costs you can't afford one ' :-)<br>

When you are curious about stuff like this it often pays to have a search on some of the websites which offer free information from patents. <br>

From the name and that bit of info I think I can deduce <br>
what they are and how they work, but not the exact details.  <br>
<br>
An interference filter is made by depositing layers of transparent material with two very different refractive indexes on a substrate with very tightly controlled thicknesses.  The substrate can be glass, quartz, or similar.  As light (or IR or UV) passes through the layers the reflection from the boundries can be additive or subtractive as a function of wavelength and the thickness of each layer.   Think about the colors you see from an oil film on water.  The colors come from the fact the oil is not of uniform thickness and the fact that oil and water have different refractive indexes. That's a very simple one layer interferece filter with less than optimum dielectric materials. <br>
<br>
Properly made interference filters can be better reflectors than the best metal mirrors and can give better transmission than a bare glass window.  Anti-reflective coatings are a simple form of an interference fiter.   Interference filters don't absorb energy, at least very little.  THey either pass a wavelength or reflect it.  They can however be combined with absorbtive filters and an absorbtive filter can even be used as the substrate for the interference filter. There are two advantages of interference filters over absorbtion filters.  First they can handle very high power levels since the energy can be bounced back toward the source.  Second, they can be made to have vary narrow absorbtion or reflection bands to control specific wavelengths.  The disadvantage of interference filters is they're expensive to make and they typically &quot;leak&quot; at wavelenghts other than the one you're interested in.   The advantage of absorbtion filters is that they are usually cheaper, have very broad characteristics which extend way into the UV and far IR.  They are commonly used together.  The cost of interference is in the setup and the required equipment.  If the filters are made in large quantities they can be inexpensive.  If you look at an interference filter it usually looks like a mirror, perhaps a colored one.  Looking though it it may have color, be opaque, or transparent depending on what wavelenghts it passes or blocks.  It may look like a mirror from one side and opaque or colored on the other if it's bonded to an absorbtion filter.   <br>
This website gives a look into how real interference filters are constructed:<br>
<br>
http://www.thermo.com/eThermo/CDA/Support/Support_Detail/0,1153,15845-127,00.html?<br>
<br>
In my astronomy work I use interference and absorbtion filters to sort out bands of light to help determine the temperatures and other characteriscs of the stars.<br>
<br>
So what is a LIF?   High power lasers can damage eyes by focusing pulses of energy onto the retina.  In the same manner high power laser light focused by the objective of a NV scope can damage an intensifier or a thermal array or whatever the sensor might be.   LIF is a generic term for filters which use interference (plus absorbtion) to stop the common laser wavelengths.<br>
<br>
What are the common lasers found on a battlefield?  For non-nato countries by far the most common is 1064nm from a YAG laser.  It's easy to build a very high power (multi megawatt) pulse laser at that wavelength. YAG work great for rangefinders to 30Km or so.  They aren't visible to either the human eye or (most) Gen III scopes.  They are visible to GEN 0,1,and 2 scopes, though they're not very sensitive that far into the IR.  A typical YAG rangefinder, even a handheld one, can put out a 100,000 watt pulse.  I's not long duration so the total energy is low, but it's enough to damage a human eye or damage an intensifier with a direct hit.<br>
There are some Gen III systems specifically designed to be able to see light from a YAG laser. Check out:<br>
<br>
http://www.littoneos.com/pdf_library/s_pvs-13.pdf<br>
<br>
What are other common high power laser wavelengths?  The US is converting to erbium lasers for their rangefinders.  They have similar characteristics to YAG except for a longer wavelength (about 1.5 microns)  They are considered eyesafe (at least a lot safer)  but can still damage intensifiers.  There are also some old ruby rangefinders around which are visible in the deep red and very bad for eyes and intensifiers as they typically worked at high power than even the YAG's.  YAG can be frequency doubled to produce an intense green light at 532nm.  Perhaps you've seen the police &quot;blinding&quot; lasers. They are intended to disorient a person without actually producing permanent damage.  They only have medium power, a watt or so.   <br>
That would be another possible wavelength to block.  I don't know which of those, or others, a LIF actully blocks.  It would be interesting to test one on a spectrophotometer.  I couldn't find a web site with that information. <br>
<br>
So do you need a LIF? That depends on who you're going to look at with your NV equipment and what equipment they have. It will not protect your scope from a broadband light source like the sun or a xenon arc or strobe.  They will block a little useful light so the image in the scope will be slightly dimmer.  I don't know how much. <br>
<br>
As I say, I pulled this together from what I read on the web today and my knowledge of interference filters in general.  I may have some points about LIF wrong.  <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 6, 2002, 6:54 PM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010372042'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I knew what they are, and what they are for,  though for some reason they are referred to at least in some documents as &quot;light interference filter&quot; actually on the little case, it is called that.   Lou, your comrehensive explanation of how they work, was exactly what I was looking for.   They are a pretty neat little device to see, as when you look at or into them, they appear to change colors, depending on angle and background light.  I had one on the PVS-18 and it really did not appear to dim the image noticably.   They do nothing noticable to broadband light,  as you say,  and I am not about to shoot an IR laser in my goggle to see if it really works!!   I had suggested this as a possible precaution for guys using PAQ-4's etc, in case the beam got reflected back.  I would guess it would do nothing as far as just protecting from the brightness you view when the laser is on, correct?<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 6, 2002, 8:34 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.132</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010378098'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I doubt the LIF filters the wavelength of a PAQ-4 (830nm).  Interference fiters are &quot;linear&quot; with intensity, so if it did filter that wavelength then you'd just need more power to use the PAQ-4 as a pointer.  Besides, unless you bounce it off a good mirror it's unlikly to have enough energy to burn the photocathode.  Hitting some grass at 100 feet will light up the viewer but it's not likely to do permanent damage if you don't leave it there. <br>
<br>
If you want to test your filter I have a 10 megawatt Q-switched YAG in my lab. ;-)<br>

			<P></center>Protecting eyes isn't quit the same as protecting NV equipment.  Yag lasers are very close to the range that image tubes operate in.  The military has plastic lens goggles (for human eyes)  which do a good job of blocking yag and ruby lasers under battlefield conditions.  I've bought them surplus for as little as $20. THey just seem like dark green sunglasses but with goggles which block light from the sides.  Good commercial laser goggles typically run $100-200 and are &quot;tuned&quot; to the particular laser being usd.  THey also block light coming from any direction.   If you try to protect against all lasers with a single unit you wouldn't be able to see through them.   <br>
<br>
If someone is selling &quot;shades&quot; which are supposed to protect against lasers ask the seller what lasers it protects against.  If they don't have specifications then it's probably just a pair of sunglasses.<br>

			<P></center>these filters don't seem to actually &quot;filter&quot; out the light, they more or less control it.  I mean you can still see the laser light, etc.  I was using an IR laser, and a visible one and could still see it fine with the LIF in,   then I took the filter off, shined the laser through it onto the wall,  and there it was,  though possibly not as bright and focused.  Amazing stuff.   When are they going to have the thin clear film glasses like Mission Impossible? <br>

			<P></center>You did a test at one IR wavelength.  You could see the light with little attenuation through the scope.  You then shined the laser through the filter and you could still see it. If you didn't that would be amazing.  All that tells you is the filter isn't designed to protect against that wavelength.  It SHOULD only protect against the wavelengths of the more powerful lasers used the potential enemies the US military is likely to come up against.  That will at least block 1064nm YAG and perhaps a few other specific lines.  Blocking 1064 does not reduce the performace of a Gen III scope since it has almost no sensitivity at that wavelength anyway.<br>
<br>
To make optics which protect against all laser wavelengths is easy.  A metal mirror will do that. The trouble is you won't be able to see through it, with or without a NV scope. <P><center><i>Posted on Jan 7, 2002, 10:51 PM<BR> from IP address 192.33.141.150</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010472693'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Since miltary pointers like the PAQ-4 don't have a built in detector to cut the power when the beam reflects off a nearby object I can only surmise that it's not a big enough problem to worry about.  Yes, a sustained bright spot on an image tube will damage it.  A laser so bright as to cause damage will be too bright to allow you to see the target well. It should be &quot;just easily visible&quot; through the NV scope  It's not difficult to adjust the brightness of a diode laser with a pulse width modulator. About $1 in parts if it's built into the laser driver.  <br>
<br>
It woudn't make sense for the LIF filter to block or even attenuate a wavelength you're trying to see. Emitting more power than you need just wastes batteries and makes you more visible to other NV equipment.<br>
<br>
On a battlefield a LIF filter makes sense. A possible downside is they might prevent you from knowing you're being probed with a rangfinder.  For a hunter or for use while hiking I see no benefit at all. <br>

			<P></center>the mall guy.  Actually,  I have a pretty good idea, but not saying anything-yet.  You know you got everyone going with that post about not being able to say who you are!

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>problems</b><br>by tech fix<P></center>in the night vision business there is so much competition among dealers i would be cutting my own throat to say who i was or what companies i do repair work for. as i do work for companies that do not get along to put it mildly. i never went to school for any of this so all of my knowledge is by hands on experience (just under eleven years) starting with smuggled russian stuff.<P><center><i>Posted on Jan 13, 2002, 4:10 PM<BR> from IP address 209.244.93.28</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1010967023'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Yes I'm an amateur in this field. My profession has nothing to do with military night vision equipment or laser protection filters. I design and construct automated telescopes for use in astronomy.<br>
<br>
Anyone with an Internet connection can glean as much as has been presented on this discussion group about LIF's if they know a little about optics in general and look at a few websites.  <br>
<br>
Since you're apparently an expert on LIF's would you mind providing some useful information about them which is only eluded to on the various military and manufactureres sites. In particular, what wavelength ranges do the Litton LIF filters block?  I stated I was making assumptions about that and don't have one to measure.  <br>
<br>
Per Webster's Unabridged: amateur 1. A person who engages in a study, sport, or other activity for pleasure rather than financial benefit or professional reasons.<br>
<br>
Being an amateur says nothing about skill or knowledge.<br>
Compare a mistress to a prostitute.  Either could be more skilled or knowledgable.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>restricted items</b><br>by tech fix<P></center>first off I never said I was an expert. in my opinion no body is ever an expert in any field. the moment you think of yourself as one and as the best you stop striving to learn or accept any other input other than your own. since the LIF is a restricted item the military or manufacturers cannot publish the data on this item. and if you were Litton even if you could would you publish a proprietary trade secret ? and filters do block more than one wavelength of light at a time such as the minus blues on ANVIS goggles. they will only allow colors red and above through the glass.the changes in force for the Army was issued 25 Jan.  1991 the paper work in my hand states .   the light interference filter (LIF) included with this AN/PVS-7B is a laser protection filter. this filter should be used at the discretion of the unit commander, based upon his/her assessment of the laser threat in the theater. use of this filter will result in a slight reduction in system gain.<br>

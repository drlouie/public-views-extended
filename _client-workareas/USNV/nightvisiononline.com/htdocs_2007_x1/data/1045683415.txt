I just talked with John, the other forum owner, &nbsp;and he confirmed what Chris said in the previous post. &nbsp; They are committed to making this the best NV forum on the web. &nbsp;It does have some bugs, and of course some things that people may not like, &nbsp;that is what polite criticism is for. &nbsp; Please continue to contact them, or me, &nbsp;or post your desires, critiques, and ideas for improvement. &nbsp; It may take a week or two to get things the way we all like them, &nbsp;but it will happen. &nbsp; The forum is still dedicated to the NV enthusiast, &nbsp;as is the entire website. &nbsp;Search function is coming, by the way. &nbsp; &nbsp;Don't run off just yet, &nbsp;the ship is not sinking!!(nor is it stealing your private info EX-11B) The only problem I have right now is that I cannot figure out how to change my username back to Lanny??

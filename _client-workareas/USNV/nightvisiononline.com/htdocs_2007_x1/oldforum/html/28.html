The image is dimmer. I would have thought that the step up power supply wont function with out sufficient voltage.<br>
<br>
So I made a slight modification and isolated the two battery chambers so that one gave 3V and the other 1.5V<br>
Then I put in a lever swith as selector.<br>
The result, I have a 2 step variable gain 502!<br>
I am going to try a variable resistor next.<br>
<br>
Before I do something stupid I like to ask the 502 expert how the power supply functions and whether my little experiment would see the last of my 502.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 18, 2002, 7:25 PM<BR> from IP address 202.64.24.158</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1027045544'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Actually</b><br>by

			<P></center>the two separate battery compartments are in parallel, so the unit runs on the 3v in each side,  unless you have a 502 that I have not seen before.  Doesn't it use 4small 1.5v cells,  with 2 in each side adding up to 3v each side?  All the 502's I have ever seen use this setup and the manual calls for some mil type battery(4) that are the same size as the N batteries, but the poles are reversed like all the military stuff, or most of it. You just put the N cells in opposite the battery outline, but following the polarity markings.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 18, 2002, 7:32 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.25</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1027045939'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>502</b><br>by Edwin<P></center>I have the same 502.<br>
The battery cover earths the negatives to the housing via the screw.<br>
I put a tape over the battery cover to isolate the cover from the batteries then I insert a copper strip between the battery negatives and the cover for each chamber taking care that the copper DOESN'T touch the housing.<br>
In one chamber I put in 2 N type giving 3 V, and the other a AAA with an insulated metal extension giving 1.5V.<br>
Now I connected the 2 leads onto the 2 ends of a lever switch and earthed the middle leg of the switch to the housing.<br>
Now I have a 2 step variable gain 502.<br>
It works. Now I can look street lights in the eye.<br>

			<P></center>I guess the maybe the 1.5 is drawing the 3v down to 2something and dimming the tube a bit then?  That would sort of make sense I guess.   I have not experimented with voltage input levels with those other than the first one I ever had, and I tried all sorts of stuff before realizing that the tubes were broken in it.  Let me just say that you can apply much more than 3v and not damage the power supply,  but I would not suggest it.   I had no manual and no idea what the batteries were so tried anything that would fit. At that time no one in the industry seemed to know anything about those scopes or the batteries for them.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 18, 2002, 8:15 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.25</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1027048510'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>502</b><br>by Edwin<P></center>After isolating the two chambers I have a choice of 3V or 1.5V I wont mix the 2 volatges in parallel or the batteries may short out.<br>
What I am worried is that the oscillater may over load trying to push the voltage up to standard working level. If there is no fed back control on the oscillator then I'll be fine.<br>
I am a bit puzzled if I can do that why wasnt it done before ?<br>
A little modification on the battery cover would deliver a variable gain 502. Much more robust than my dangling wires.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 18, 2002, 8:50 PM<BR> from IP address 202.64.24.158</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1027050617'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>mess with that when I get a chance.  I have an 18mm assembly in a 502 sleeve that operates somewhat differently also.  It has a very sensitive high light sensor built into the power supply apparently and will not even come on unless the front of the tube is covered except for a pinhole, if there is the tiniest amount of light anywhere around.  <P><center><i>Posted on Jul 19, 2002, 4:47 AM<BR> from IP address 216.37.190.61</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1027079234'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Re: I may</b><br>by Edwin<P></center>I am curious. Does the tube needs that kind of protection? With such sensitivity the scope would auto power down everytime you happen to look at a street lamp or full moon.<br>
Does the control uses a separate light sensitve diode or simply monitor/limit the current?<br>

			<P></center>that when I actually go to use it, any light source at all will shut it down.  There is no external device, it is all inside the tube/power supply.  I thought the assy was bad when I first got it as it would not power up at all.

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Power surge</b><br>by Edwin<P></center>It looks like the power supply has a failed or poorly calibrated break circuit. Any sudden surge of current would cause a break. <br>
Or could there be a high voltage leak (arcing) that triggered a shut down? I may be wrong. Does bright light draws more current?<br>

			<P></center>it does draw more current with more light.   Weird thing is that it is silent also,  so must be a newer type of supply.

Seems like a little thing sometimes,  but other times it is oh so handy.  Of course the glow is not really visible from any distance unless the other guy has NV also,  but it is nice not to have the unit on,  say you remove it to switch on a light in the car or turn the headlights on or something like that,  it is really handy when driving.

My Aquilla came on for awhile the other night with the original power supply and it seems like the image was not that bright. Is there alot of light loss with the big lens? It could be my power sup not putting out enough juice but the bigger lens should have more light loss than a PVS14 lens. I wonder if i got a gen2+ or something.It did have great resolution though. Does anyone have both and could you give me a comparison in image brightness.<br>

It has a very good resolution but now that i think about it the aquilla tube looked &quot;greener&quot; than all my gen3 stuff.I'm going to see if i can modify a pvs14 tube and put it in it.It would be nice to add adj gain along with the upgrade to gen3. That is if it's not gen3 already.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Re: ITT 6015 and raptor</b><br>by code-1<P></center>I had a chance to look at a 4x raptor a year ago through a sheriffs dep. I had a 4x 343 with a 51lp/mm tube in it we compared the two which I know is not real fair do tho the cost difference,but anyway.The raptor was tougher built and gave about a 20-30 brighter picture on that star light night and was a touch clearer.Well I bought a 343 with a 64lp/mm tube a few weeks ago and it is 20-30 brighter on a star light night than my old 343.I think the performance is going to be only alittle less than the raptor I looked at with the new 64lp/mm 343. Not 3000$ more performance anyway. With that said the raptor is a better built scope and very,very  nice scope overall.Just I expected alot more out of the raptor I guess do to the extra cost.Maybe I just though it would kick the 343s ass by a whole bunch.I can't see the military useing the 343 since it is not built for a 50cal or to be dragged through a swamp,but for the normal NV user the 343 should be all they need.Is 10% extra performance worth twice as much?? The raptor did have a cleaner tube since my new 343 has 2 small specks to the side of the FOV.I guess if I was richer I would buy the raptor to.Anyway the raptor is for sure a nice scope,but I guess maybe I expected it to be a gaint killer for the money it cost.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 19, 2002, 5:43 PM<BR> from IP address 24.117.27.48</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1027125830'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Burning spot?</b><br>by Bertie<P></center>A few months after receiving my NV unit (russian 2nd generation, the only gear available for a reasonable price over here in Holland).<br>
I went into the dark and switched the unit on while holding it in viewing position.<br>
While turning it on, a light spot appeared slightly above the center of the tube and the unit turned itself of, it was like somebody taking a picture with a flashlight.<br>
Notice, there was no bright light source, not even out of the field of view!<br>
I send it to the dealer (well known in our neighbour country Germany) and received it back repaired, after 1 week with a black (burning?)spot exactly on the position where the bright spot appeared before the unit shut of itself.<br>
The dealer said it was my own fault because I had turned it on while looking at a bright light.<br>
That's not true but I'm the only one who knows that for sure.<br>

Can all models accept the 3x accessory lens, and what does this accessory cost? Can you use the 3X lens AND the compass accessory at the same time?  What is the performance in lp/mm of the different variations?<br>
What do you gain be buying the Mil version over the commercial version?<br>
What is the price of each model, in today's realistic night vision prices (i.e. PVS-4 in Gen II - $1K, Gen III PVS-4 $2300, night vision is not selling that well lately, and the prices have dropped alot on most units.)<br>

			<P></center>The A/C is a totally different goggle, though similar in size and performance than the B/D.   They have totally different optics,  though the optics performance is about the same.  The eye relief is a bit longer on the A.  The C version is submersible, and can be pressurized with nitrogen.  B's range from $2500-$3200 usually with commercial tubes.  D version of the B is usually $3900-$4200.   A is somewhere around $4K depending on  a few variations,  C is $4500 or more depending on some variations.   The 3X lens of the B/D is not made for the A/C but it can fit when used with the LIF as a reducer bushing.  With that setup it works pretty well. The A/C has it's own set of lenses in 3,4 and 6X, the B/D has 3 and 5X.  The compass will not work with the magnifying lens in place.   The tube resolutions vary from 36lp(old)45lp, 51lp, and 64lp, with a variety of other performance specs.   I have forgotten the rest of your questions though.<br>
A/C has an auto on/off switch position for use with head mounts, B/D has an auto off funtion and then must be reset to on manually.  <br>

			<P></center>I know of two places selling surplus 7A's for around $1400-$2000, depending on accessories.  And here is a 7B that came with everything, and still only sold for $2K (and it included the headmount and 3X lens, mil cases, demist, etc.)<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
Brand new Gen 3 goggle package with about 1-hour use if that on the tube, 51 LP minium, milspec with no blemishes, pin dots, or imperfections loaded down with the following new accessories; 3x magnification lens and case, 7 bravo headset with demist filters and sacrifical front filter, helmet mount, soft carry case and data sheet $1900 reserve.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I have seen the 7c's go on recently for around $2500, with full accessories.<br>
<br>
Maybe the same thing is happening to the 7's that is happening to the Gen II and Gen III PVS-4's. You know what the Gen III PVS-4's used to sell for, even 6 months ago.  Now guys with really nice scopes can't even get a single bid for $2300!  and Gen II's are at around $950 now!  Seems a shame, really, but that is reality for you!.  MX11620 tube reserve was $2K, highest bid was $560!  Go figure, a year ago the tube was $3500, just for the tube!<br>
<br>
Good news is with the price decrease, guys who only thought they could afford the lower cost Gen I stuff can now get Gen II scopes at a much lower delta than every before.<br>
<br>
I can't wait until the Gen III Raptors hit the market in a few years, probably at around $3500!!  Doc also believes this will happen!  <br>
<br>
Thanks for answering all my questions.  p.s. - my Gen II PVS-4 is fixed, it was a simple fix really, I will tell you about it sometime!  Thanks for all your help!<br>
Oh, I also ordered the (supposedly) last complete set of Swill Mil binocs ~ should be at my office when I return.  I like mine so much I bought a complete set for my Dad!  He loves them!<br>

			<P></center>he said 2 sets for $3500 which would make them $1750 if you buy both.  Secondly,  he admitted that he bought them on ebay some time back,  so really there is no known history of use, other than his saying he only used them for so many hours.   Where did they come from?  Who used them, how, and for how long?  What conditions?That is not a bad price considering the risk involved.   Not that they may not be very nice, near perfect, but no warranty, etc, etc.   Again, the prices I listed were based on retail NEW item values for information purposes only, in answer to the original question, unless I misunderstood it?  I thought he was looking for price and type comparisons on the various 7 types?<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 17, 2002, 9:53 PM<BR> from IP address 205.238.244.86</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026968006'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I doubt if anyone keeps the actual time on their tube written down, plus I shoot more than almost anyone I know, and still only use approx. 30 hours total per year!  So it would take me 10 years to use just 300 hours!  You can read my post a few months back on this &quot;surplus tube hours&quot; subject.<br>
<br>
So this &quot;limited tube life&quot; excuse is mostly bull, unless the tube was abused.  Yes, you take your chances with ebay, or with surplus.  But I have seen NEW night vision systems from reputable suppliers that were advertised as wonderful, and were the opposite.  and had problems with mechanical construction as well!<br>
<br>
My advice is buy the surplus unit, in good condition, for half the price, and enjoy the unit.  I have had many night vision units, all of them used, and have never had a bad tube among the lot.  This includes older Russian scopes, etc.<br>
<br>
I have seen new stuff at the gun show from mainstream NV guys that I would not have bought if they were 1/3rd of the price!  My surplus units usually perform better than the new units, at a fraction of the cost.<br>
<br>
Just my .02, and the warranty thing is kind of a joke among most of the NV guys anyway.  I have been told that numerous times by people we both know and respect!  It sounds really good if you need to justify the higher price, but they will tell you that only about .5% of ALL the NV devices they sell ever come back for warranty work, so it is an easy thing for them to include.  Now, given the choice between warranty or no warranty, at the same cost as the surplus unit?  Well, hell, I would take the warranty too.  But to pay and extra $500-$1500 for a &quot;new&quot; unit with a &quot;warranty&quot;, not worth it in my book.<br>
<br>
But you do have much nicer equipment than I, so the warranty vs. price issue is probably a different animal for you than for me.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 17, 2002, 10:06 PM<BR> from IP address 198.81.16.162</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026968810'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>again,   I am not saying don't buy used,  just that you cannot compare unknown used price with new prices,  no matter how you look at it.  Sure you can get some great deals on good used stuff,   I have done it plenty.  And to some people the security of a new warranted product justifies the price.  Others are happy to take the risk and save the money.  Nothing wrong with either approach, just different ways of looking at things.  Otherwise there would not be any new products if no on bought them,  and then there would not be any used products if the new buyers didn't keep buying and selling off the used.   To rely on the military surplus is risky since most of that stuff is not surplus, but channeled out through various means.  <P><center><i>Posted on Jul 18, 2002, 5:55 AM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.175</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026996926'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>those prices were based on approximate current NEW item prices, not stuff that is for sale from unknowns on ebay or wherever.  I have found some nice stuff there, but it is always a risk.    If you know of a NEW set of 7C's for $2500,  I would probably buy them,  though I have 2 sets already omni-4 and 5, so don't know why.  I have my doubts you will ever see a new $3500 Raptor,  but then you never know.   They will just continue to upgrade the image tubes in that high end stuff rather than flog it off with older tubes at a cut price, or at least that would be my guess.   Now with the omni-6 contract,  the price of the gen 3 stuff may drop somewhat.  I would not plan on any half price stuff though.  Guess I could be wrong though.  That gen 3 tube is still around for your PVS-4 by the way.<br>

The high end military PVS-7's that are currently available are the 7D version with mil-spec tube, and they come at least from NGLitton with a couple extra devices.  The units are assembled by the govt vendors also and tested as compared to commercial ones assembled by whoever assembles them.  Not to say that is bad, just different.

			<P></center>I see that somebody (Surplus Ltd) has already bid on them and therefore you cannot make any changes. Since you have a reserve set for that item you are protected somewhat. As far as starting the bidding at $100 you may find that will help get more people bidding on your item and in the long run help you sell your item. Just be sure your reserve is what you are willing to accept and you should be O.K. The only other option is to stop your auction early, find out from Ebay why you are limited to $100 and then relist at a later date. I suspect that since you are new to Ebay (nothing bought or sold) that this may have something to do with it. At any rate as I said, if your reserve is set for what you are willing to accept you ought to be fine.

I did set my reserve at $1600 fair price I feel, don't hesitate to bid to get it up there, just remember the reserve and stop short and if you win by chance I wont hold you to it...IS THIS ETHICAL???

			<P></center>I think you better take the time to read the rules of selling and bidding on Ebay. What you suggested could get you and the bidder into serious trouble and permanently suspended from Ebay. You have a lot of $$ tied up in your equipment and if you really want people to buy or bid on your auctions you don't serve yourself very well by suggesting something this dishonest. If you don't care about your reputation and want to go down the wrong road believe me you will get caught. Just be patient and let the auction run it's course and you may well get your reserve price you are asking.

			<P></center>technically that would be shill bidding,  and if the reserve is reached you are obligated to sell,  though as long as ebay gets their cut,  you don't have to go through with the sale, but you still have to pay the pecentage to ebay on the final price.   Asking people to bid up your item is the shill bidding thing and if caught doing it you would be suspended from ebay.   Normally it is done after the reserve is reached or if there is no reserve,  to drive up the price and hopefully get honest bidders to beat the price.   Very not nice,  and totally against the concept of fair auctioning.

			<P></center>I understand that,  and have been trying not to mention my price so as not to undercut his sale, since he buys from USNV and all.  I cannot figure why no one on ebay seems interested,  but then I have sold about 5 or 6 of them in the last few months,  gotten a lot of trade offers too.  I did make a couple of trades with guys.   I keep saying I am going to get this one I still  have mounted and try it out for accuracy.   So far have only used them for viewing.

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Re: Thanks</b><br>by code-1<P></center>Lanny,I to have had a ton of trade offers.Guns,NV scopes,other optics and even a old car.I will always trade for something if I need it or can make alittle money on it.The only thing really interesting so far was a brand new browning 20ga grade 1 over&amp;under super light  from a gun store here.It is worth 1200-1300$ whole sale.The problem is I don't really need it and it may be harder to sell than my 242.I don't now how large the market is for 1000$+ shotguns elsewhere,but it is not good here in my small town.I had a guy with a older 45lp/mm NVPS-10 like I had until my buddy bought it from me 2 weeks ago try to trade one like my old unit,but he seemed to think a 6.5 year old NVPS was worth 2000$ for some reason.I guess he paid too much for it. It's good to know that I am not the only broke person out there right now.The gun stores here are selling nothing right now.Ebay looks slow to.I guess it is a bad time for sales.I might go ahead and trade for the shotgun or a like new browning 270 A-Bolt with leupold Vari-X III scope another guy offered.The shotgun is worth alittle more,but I would use the rifle.I figure I would wait since I am going to Florida for a week on vacation.Maybe things will be better when I get back. Who knows,Maybe I can sell it to some young guys for watching women on the beach in the dark.Every one is always carrying binoculars down there and they don't work well after dark. Maybe I can aleast shot some NV video to email all of you.I will call it--&quot;Attack of the green bikini&quot; well maybe I won't!!<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 17, 2002, 9:39 AM<BR> from IP address 24.117.27.48</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026923955'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>honestly. <br>
i think everything is an opinion, even if it's done at a professional level. i believe there are a few unbiased dealers here. how many times have you read a review by an expert and said to yourself, &quot;the guy is full of bull****&quot;<br>

			<P></center>just remember, though they are correct in the summation that a lot of the info in NV is industry hype,  they are just another industry going in a somewhat different direction with hype of their own.  The European companies that make the super gen 2 stuff have their own brand of hype to support the products they make compared to the products available from the US.  Though nothing they said is absolutely untrue,  it is all spun in a certain direction with a predetermined goal in mind-to make you think that gen 3 is not all that great.  All I can say to that,  is try them all,  see what you like.  Gen 3 is great.  I have yet to try an XD4 type gen 2,and I am sure they are great also.   Then again,  price is involved and the European gen 2 super stuff is very expensive.   I would like to get a chance to see some of it anyway, just for comparison.   <P><center><i>Posted on Jul 16, 2002, 9:14 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.64</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026879257'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Each type will fit differently each application, as people will have different needs.  As an example, they mentioned that Gen 2 was good enough for the military, however much inferior to Gen 1, for their application.<br>
<br>
This article was interesting for being (at least for me) impartial on the technology standpoint.  They did not compare brands, just technologies.  And tried to  provide a scientific point of view.<br>
<br>
Glad you guys liked!<br>

			<P></center>I had 242's listed on Ebay several times and never got an honest bid-well at least not realistic.  I have sold quite a few but for some reason no one on ebay seemed interested.  Maybe it is just me? The 242 is really a pretty decent gen 2 sight,  and for Code's price and what I was selling them for, they were a real good deal on a variable gain gen 2.   I still have one in my office ready to go also, if you are looking for one.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 15, 2002, 8:34 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.91</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026790481'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>242S</b><br>by PAUL<P></center>     I really respect the 242 for what it is.  I had a chance to use one for a couple of days, and I thought is was one of the best 2nd gen units I've had a chance to view through, maybe the best scope anyways. At the time, they weren't even close to being under $1000. I'd like to mount one on a special, custom Ruger 10-22. I'm not a huge night time hunter, or anything like that, I just want a fun night time set up without over doing the gun with optics...only so many dollars to go around.  I would have purchased Code-1s if the timing wasn't so bad.  His price was quite fair in today's 2nd gen market, as seen by my limited knowledge in this field.  In a couple of months I'll be ready to buy. I'll will keep you in mind and contact you by e-mail, for a quote, when I get close to purchasing one.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Re: Edwin regarding Russian</b><br>by Edwin<P></center>Just my personal angle.<br>
A few of my friend , me included, wanted Gen3 scopes but every where I looked they were not for export out of US.<br>
So we approached Russian manufacturers. As we were sceptical of their quality, we only ordered one. It turned out that it has a much quieter tube than a PVS 14 (borrowed) though dimmer. But my eyes adjested and after a while I dont see much difference if not better clarity.<br>
Pricewise Russian is not that expensive if you know where to look, its just the reputation on their concept of quality control that stayed our hands. And whether to trust sending that sort of money into Russia really took some debate.<br>
But with the American products out of reach I believe that Russian is the way to go and they offer good discount on bulk.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 16, 2002, 8:48 PM<BR> from IP address 202.64.24.158</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026877711'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

I wont name the manufacturers. You dealers may want to keep some secrets. But the models are on sale on many American web sites.<br>
The people are nice to deal with but the Banking system sucks.<br>
For some reason I cant send US dollars to Russia and the money have to be routed through a Bank in New York.<br>
That took 10 days and thats just to receive that Bank's confirmation. Then it took another week before the manufacturer received their confirmation. The postage is cheap just $30 but took another 3 weeks.<br>
All this time I was very anxious. <br>
Now I understand y there are so much mark ups.

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>242</b><br>by code-1<P></center>I only had one bid,but had to cancel it because the buyer was out of the USA.I had a half of dozen people offer some type of trade on it which I am still thinking on a few of those.I can't belive it didn't sell at that price. It is as close to brand new as you can get and it cost well over a thousand new.I went out of town hunting hogs the last two and half days and just got back a hour ago.I went with three friends so the 242 was a extra scope for spoting and my two 343s were on a gun.I spoted most of the time since I have shot hogs at my ranch a bunch already this year.The 242 worked real well out to 100-150 yards for clear shooting( if I was shooting) and could spot a black hog feeding in a bean field 200-300 yards or so.The 343 could shot 250 yards and spot 400-500 yards with the 1/8 moon we had .The 242 looked really good until you look at the 343.I guess I am spoiled to that 3rd gen clarity.I guess its all about price.Pay less and get a little closer. Over all the 242 is a nice gen 2 scope and it is unfair to compare it to the 343 which cost twice as much to start with.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 16, 2002, 2:33 PM<BR> from IP address 24.117.27.48</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026855215'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>VERY SURPRISED THE 242 DIDN'T SELL</b><br>by PAUL<P></center>     It is truly one of the great values in night vision right now.  Lanny stated that he had very little luck selling 242s on E-bay.  It must just be a different type of buyer or somthing. I can't really figure is out.   <br>
     I've never viewed through a 343. I can only compare the 242 to other gen.3 units, and as you<br>
pointed out, it's not comparable to gen.3. Even an<br>
inexperienced viewer, could rather quickly, tell which one was better.  I just like the 242 for what it is.<br>
I have plans to install a 242 on a custom 10-22.<br>
Considering the maximum range that .22s are normally<br>
fired at, I believe a 242 is more than enough scope, with plenty of resolution.  I'd rather put the more serious optics on more serious toys.<br>
     I would have purchased your 242,if the timing wasn't so goofy.  I'm just finishing two toy projects that I had to stretch for a little.  Lanny hinted that<br>
he still had a 242 also.  When I'm ready to buy, I'll<br>
contact you.  I told Lanny the same thing.  I know how<br>
much you want for yours and I know it's pretty much brand new.  If you still have your 242, when I'm ready to buy, I'll probably just buy yours.  I'm sure Lanny's price is close to the same, but I did see yours first.  I'm about 2-3 months away. If you still<br>
have it then, great, I'll pay your price.<br>

			<P></center>I must address this to Terry whom continues to use my board after he agreed that he would not. Terry and Tech-Fix were banned by ne because they displayed an non-professional attitude (my opinion) and lets face it we are all professional in our work life. Terry actaully posted slanderous, unfounded text about my company which is on file with my attorney.<br>
<br>
I will clarify why I do not allow constent posting of advertisments by the likes of Terry.<br>
<br>
A. Professional companies pay for advertising and use press and free listings as a small part of the marketing picture.<br>
<br>
B. I cannot guarantee the quality of the product or the dealings of the poster, as Terry has proven he can certainly get bad responses from customers. <br>
<br>
C. This forum was not started for financial purposes, I personally love night vision technology and have another business to generate capital. To clutter this board with advertisements with companies that have no recourse would ruin everything. Paying advertisers have a commitment to there marketing dollars and are typically reputable, free advertisers are mavericks and no recourse is available.<br>
<br>
D. If you want a deal, buyer beware, do not cry if you get burned, that is the game you choose to play. Buy from Ebay where there is at least some legal recourse.<br>
<br>
E.For what is worth I own this forum and will not display ads for other forums or products that I cannot personally guarantee. The owner is always the responsible party.<br>
<br>
F. If you want to buy from Terry, I do not care, he posts enough that I cannot catch them all. Competition builds industries and I welcome it. It makes products better and drives prices down, Shuold Terry become such a force my hat is off. At this point I think he is flattering himself to even call his business competition.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: Be Professional and act responsibly. <br>
<br>

			<P></center>I have been wanting a set of these now for a long time.  I have yet to take them underwater,  since I want to check the purge on them,  and I don't have the special adapter yet for these that allows  you to keep the unit sealed during purging and backfilling.   Anyway,  they could be for sale, but I am not anxiously trying to sell them at this point.   The pinnacle does beckon though,  so I guess if you are serious we could talk about a price, kit or goggle only, etc.  Email me if you are seriously interested.  Price would well exceed $2500.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 14, 2002, 7:50 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.92.152</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026701427'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Remember that the human eye can only see what we call visible light while night vision can see visible and into the neart I.R. . and as it detects this light it not only makes it visible but it also amplifies it thousands of times so I.R. can be more damaging as some night vision is even more sensitive in the near I.R. region of the light spectrum.  <P><center><i>Posted on Jul 13, 2002, 11:15 AM<BR> from IP address 205.188.192.52</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026584147'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Most I.R. lasers are L.E.D.'s they are both made out of the same elements just configured differently so you get an actuall coherent emission instead of emitting light in all directions.  I have used a 6 d-cell maglite to illuminate a one thousand meter target.  So for closer ranges a lot less light is needed.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 13, 2002, 11:43 AM<BR> from IP address 205.188.192.52</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026585838'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>An 840 nm laser will be less visible to the eye and more visible to a genII viewer than an 880nm LED with the same output power.  The human eye has a little sensitivity out to 800 nm, (down by a factor of about a million relative to green light), but falling rapidly little beyond that. An 880 nm LED has about 1% of it's energy outside of +/-100 nm of the center wavelength.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>potting</b><br>by Woody<P></center>your intensifier assymbly consists of three components. The intensifier tube, the power supply (around the tube), and the boot or sleeve that it is &quot;potted&quot; in. the power supply is soldered and then bonded to and at the same time insulated from the tube and also encapsulated with an RTV type silicon (that contains corrosion inhibitors) into the boot or sleeve.  Your problem sounds like there has been a failure of either the bonding or insulating ability of the silicon due to moisture, age, vibration, etc. .Repotting your tube would consist of removing the tube and power supply from the sleeve or boot. testing each seperate component replacing any defective parts and then re-encapsulating the tube and power supply. <P><center><i>Posted on Jul 12, 2002, 4:43 PM<BR> from IP address 152.163.189.132</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026517397'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Another few questions if you do not mind - On my PVS-7's</b><br>by Anonymous<P></center>if I leave them sitting around for awhile and then put a battery in them I will notice flickering and other things related to dirty contacts. I pull the tube, clean the contacts, put them back together and they are fine for sometimes quite awhile. If I forget and leave the battery in then it will happen a little quicker. I try to take the battery out every time after use and have gotten into the habit now of disassembling the tube from the housing and have found that it is a lot longer in between cleaning of the contacts. Could this possibly be a result of not nitrogen purging the goggles? Also is there a correct way to clean these contacts and maybe some type of cleaner/chemical that could be applied to these contacts to keep them from corroding (if that is what is happening). I keep the goggles in a nice case and have never allowed them to get around moisture. I have even purchased a new body for them and still see the same thing happening. I also seen on this forum at one time a posting concerning a lubricant that could be used on the threads of the PVS-7, do you know what that may be and where it can be purchased?

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>purging</b><br>by Woody<P></center>The problem could be related to not purging but it is hard to really pin it down. There are many factors that could cause your problem. The potting compound could have been not mixed, had an air bubble, not bonded properly, heating and cooling could cause exspansion and contraction at different rates and create a void that could then be susceptable to corona arcing between the tube and power supply. However your problem does not sound like it is a total breakdown of the potting compound. thereis a point somewhere in your tube that is allowing high voltage to leak and when condition are right it arcs temperature, humidity, ambient light, and overall voltage are all factors that will cause variances in when the tube assymbly will start arcing.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 13, 2002, 11:33 AM<BR> from IP address 205.188.192.52</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026585209'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

The red dot/mono sighting setup is nice but if you are going to do alot of night shooting you may be better off with a dedicated NV sight.  I find that the dot/mono set up has a very limited field of view and has no magnificaion for longer shots.  I believe you can put a 3x lens on a pvs 14 and put it behind the M2 but I have not tried this yet... I can let you know in the future.  You can play with the distance between the NV and sight to change the FOV.  I prefere them with a bit of separation but my brother likes them close together.<br>
<br>
What I am experimenting with now is a cheep laser with a attenuating filter(old cut down sunglass lens).  This allows me to put a barrel mounted laser site on my pellet gun, and 10/22 and move the NV on the weaver mount between the two with little hassel.  I don't like laser sights in general but I found this works best from a practical point of view.  I still need a better filter since the filter spreads the laser dot out too much.  <br>
<br>
My M2 stays on my AR but in the end I rarly fire it at night, but the combo sure looks cool!!<br>

Contacts are probably the best way to go.  If you are not too blind then you can use the diopter correction in some NVGs (PVS14 and PVS7s)but then you have to put your glasses back on when you take the NV off.<br>

			<P></center>Both are similar and look almost identical except the PVS-14 has adjustable gain and sometimes higher resolution. They both fit easily behind the red dot but you will probably want a flat top receiver AND a Quad rail handguard for good eye relief. Email me and I will send you a photo of my set up if you need it.<br>
Hope that helps some,<br>

			<P></center>What do you suggest for a lens on the 14?<br>
I am at the point that I am wanting to buy some accessories for my NV to enhance my enjoyment but noticed that when it comes to lenses there seem to be quite a few choices.<br>
I am looking for magnification since the lens on the 14 is 1X but I do not want it too look blurry or too dark either. Obviously, money is always a factor so recommendations, with and without price consideration, would be appreciated.<br>
Thanks<br>

			<P></center>I have seen a lot of night vision on ebay that seems like good deals but my question is how do you know what you are getting for your money?<br>
I am not a night vision expert, and I only have one piece to compare others to, and I sure can't do that online, so how do you make sure you don't get ripped off, other than avoiding the guys with the bad reputations?<br>
Thanks<br>

			<P></center>Especially on high-ticket items....<br>
After the item has been delivered, the buyer gets the opportunity to check the equipment out within a designated time frame. During this time frame he's obligated to follow certain guidelines made by the seller.<br>
Obviously the seller is not going to intentionally send out a unit that would be misrepresented in any way like blems in the tube, dark spots, damaged equipment etc..<br>
 Escrow is one of the many avenues you can select, it gives the buyer an indication that the seller is trying to show some type of honesty in doing a transaction... <br>
PS: The night vision business is a Dog Eat Dog business, since 1988 it hasent changed, dealers will lie, cheat, steal, do what ever it takes to get YOUR<br>
business and whoever steps in their way gets squashed.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 10, 2002, 10:57 PM<BR> from IP address 207.173.67.155</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026367057'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>I bought some PVS-7's off of Ebay and was very lucky</b><br>by Anonymous<P></center>because the unit was a pretty good deal and worked fine. I know some people piece together units and sell them on auction sites so my guess would be, on some of these units, no way of telling how long they may last unless they use new or close to new tubes. I would try to just look at ratings and previous auctions these sellers have had in the past (including what they have bought) to see if they have sold or purchased other night vision items. There are some good people selling good equipment out there but there is some bad stuff floating around too. Nobody can ever say for sure (even on brand new units) how long NV equipment is going to last so for your protection it is best to buy new (or almost new) so you can get some kind of warranty on the tubes. Anyway I hope you have luck as good as I have had dealing with these NV Ebay sellers. Have a great day.............<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 11, 2002, 3:58 PM<BR> from IP address 68.60.27.144</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026428283'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I bought an AN/TVS-4 on ebay for about 1/2 what I've seen it advertised anwhere else.  It works fine, a depot upgraded unit which didn't make it back to the military.   I bought a Fujinon 50mm  F/0.7 Cmount lens which fits my NAIT gen II viewer.  Talk about bright images! About 1/4 of list though still expensive.   Bought some new integrating CCD cameras at under 1/2 of list price.  They go considerably fainter than a Gen III viewer when used with a frame grabber and computer.    <br>
<br>
I've spent about $16,000 on ebay this year.  Mostly on networking and electronic test equipemnt for my business.   You do have to read the ebay bid pages  IN DETAIL before bidding and know what you're bidding on.  You can't assume anything, but I've yet to have anyone actually lie or fail to send an item I've paid for. If you can't figure out from the description what you'll be getting just don't bid.  I have bought a few pieces of junk, but in those cases it was my fault for not doing adequate research on what I was buying.  <br>
<br>
Check the number after the sellers &quot;handle&quot; on the bid form.  That's the feedback about the seller.  If it has more than about 1% negative comments, read several of them.  Don't bid if the seller doesn't seem  trustworthy.   Often theres enough info that you can email or phone the seller.  If the seller sounds or acts flakey don't bid.<br>
<br>
Good NV equipment sells well on ebay.  If you see a &quot;too good to be true&quot; deal on ebay for a popular piece of equipment it probably isn't true. Things listed as &quot;as is&quot; or &quot;not tested&quot; are best avoided.  <br>

			<P></center>i am thinking about getting the pvs17 when they become available and would like to sell my 4x raptor i bought from chris @ USNV. purchased in august of 2001 it has the hard case, manual, lens brush and the all mightly SPEC SHEET. i am not really into the long range shooting and the pvs17 would meet my needs better.<br>
<br>
the scope has seen about 10 hours tops and has never been abused. i can shoot about 4 inches at 200 yards with it on a AR15 colt Hbar and surplus military ammo. so i'm sure you sharp shooters can do better. the ARMS throw lever mount is absolutely repeat zero.<br>
<br>
if your interested the best way to contact me is through email. <br>
<br>
price is $6000 and i can take credit cards.<br>

<br>
Here's some info on the 210. ITT probably replaced them with the 220, which is a simular model. Unlike the 210, the 220 has adjustable gain control, great for adjusting the brightness of the scope to different light conditions. <br>
<br>
I can't quickly find all my old info on the 210, but I believe it has a different f stop rating than the 220. I'm also not sure if the 210 is electronic focus or not. I'll see if I can find my old post on the two. <br>

Hope this helps you some.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 10, 2002, 3:04 PM<BR> from IP address 152.163.189.132</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026338665'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Well several months ago I defended Terry Hensley on the night vision board to the point of getting into nasty email exchanges with other associates in the night vision business. I have now seen the light. I defended Terry because I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt on our original business transaction where I let a clear case of fraud and misrepresentation go as a mistake on Terrys part. I have now been burned twice by him and I feel like a fool. I have cut and pasted my defense of Terry on the night vision board at the bottom of this post. <br>
<br>
Last summer I was the winning bidder on one of Terry Hensleys Ebay auctions for a AN/PVS-4 night vision scope. Terry frequently posted auctions on Ebay under the user name &quot;Augman&quot; then &quot;Surplusltd&quot; and now &quot;Pot Roast&quot;. He also posts as &quot;Container&quot; and &quot;Pork chop&quot; on various boards. The auction was for a good condition fully serviceable PVS-4. The photo of the unit showed a good surplus condition PVS-4 with complete U.S. labeling. As to be expected some wear on the edges but in good condition overall. When it arrived it took me about 2 seconds to realize the PVS-4 Terry Hensley shipped me was not the PVS-4 represented in the auction. The PVS-4 Terry sent looked literally as if had been kicked across a gravel parking lot for an hour. It had no labeling whatsoever. I was quite<br>
displeased but briefly considered keeping it until I turned it over and saw the 1 inch hole in the side of the objective lens housing. The hole looked as if someone had either A. struck the scope with a ball peen hammer or B. shot it with a .45 ACP from 75 yards. I immediately emailed Terry Hensley of Surplus Ltd about the condition of the PVS-4. He admitted he used a photograph of a different PVS-4 for the Ebay auction. He told me to send it back for a refund. Terry made good on the refund but it was still a big waste of my time. Had he used an actual picture of the unit and made ANY mention of the HOLE IN THE OBJECTIVE LENS HOUSING I would have never bid on the unit. <br>
<br>
Now fast forward to June 2002. <br>
<br>
On June 2nd Terry Hensley listed a set of PVS-7A night vision goggles on Ebay with a buy it now price of $1698. He received no bids during two auctions. He also posted the goggles on Sturmgewehr and AR15.com for $1698.About a month later on June 30th Terry Hensley listed the PVS-7A for sale on nightvisiononline.com for $1500. On July 1st he dropped the price to $1400. On July 1st I emailed Terry inquiring about the condition of the PVS-7As and another night vision unit. The following is our email correspondence. <br>

Terry is there anything wrong with the 7A's or headmount that would affect performance such as broken parts, tube burns, out of spec blemishes etc? How much for shipping to 97124? <br>

There is nothing wrong with the 7a's and there is nothing wrong with the ITT 250 we upgraded to a third gen.The 7A's have a new headset. The body has a few rough spots but other than that they are flawless. Both items are priced right for the money. <br>
<br>
     I emailed again asking for the shipping amount to zip code 97124 <br>

     If you want them act immediately, Im not going to play around with this, I'm under some strain and need cash quick for a building I am constructing, I may have a loan approved later in the week but I dont want to use it if at all possiable. I'm letting all my stuff go for less $$ but once the building's up it'll be back to normal and normal retail. <br>

     I'm backing out of the 7A deal we had..... <br>
     XXX XXXXXXX (name of 3rd party deleted for privacy)needs that paticular set of goggles for testing of a load of tubes due to arrive in from ITT and <br>
I'm going to back out of our deal... I get product from XXX, tubes, housings, the works and it would make better sense for me to sell them to XXX anyway.I'll send your Certified check back 3-day Priority mail. Sorry for the inconvience. <br>
<br>
The next day I saw Terry placed a PVS-7A headmount up for sale for $300. Maybe it was a different set but unlike PVS-7B headmount 7A headsets are like hens teeth. <br>
<br>
     I received my cashiers check back as well as money to cover the priority mail so luckily all I am out is a few bucks for the cashiers check and the hour or so spent at the bank and post office. <br>
     . <br>
Now I see Terry Hensley has the gall to post on the subguns.com board of inquiry on 7-8-02 complaining about a guy who promised to purchase several AR magazines then backed out a week later after not sending payment. Now if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black. He has no problem with renigging on a deal after the customer has sent payment in a very timely manner but screams bloody murder when the tables are turned on him. As far as I am concerned Terry Hensley of Surplus-Ltd@ev1.net, aka &quot;Augman&quot;,aka &quot;Pot Roast&quot;, aka &quot;Pork Chop&quot;, aka &quot;Container&quot; is dishonest and unscrupulous. His word means nothing. I know he has his supporters (I used to be one of them)but then again even Paul Podhorn made good on some of his transactions. His negative and neutral feedback rating on Ebay speak for themselves. I wish I had listened sooner. <br>

<br>
     by Mike L. <br>
<br>
     I have sold several of the same units Surplus Ltd is selling. They are in my opinion the best value currently available in an NV weapon sight for those on a limited budget. If you want to see exactly what they look like I have a pic at www.geocities.com/mlemarte/pvs4.html . <br>
     . <br>
I have had my own issue with Terry Hensley aka augman, in the past. I will not go into them here except to say he quickly made things right which is what is most important. Terry is just one of the guys who operate Surplus ltd. I typically deal with another person there who I have found to be honest and straight forward in every dealing I have been involved in. <br>
     . <br>
I do not have any close association, nor have I been in contact with Terry Hensley aka augman for sometime, so I have no knowledge one way or another of XXXXXX's statement. However I find XXXXXX's blanketed allegation<br>
to be very reckless and libelous. Buffering that kind of allegation with &quot;I heard&quot; does not release a person from civil liability. XXXXX if you have factual knowledge than please post it. If you don't<br>
then you had absolutely no business posting that information here and damaging a persons business reputation in the process. An unanswered rumor in time becomes fact. <br>
     . <br>
Please qualify the meaning of,&quot;In jail&quot;. &quot;In jail&quot; for what? Fraud, felony theft, armed robbery? Or perhaps, DUII, Fishing without an anglers permit, or civil disobediance? As a full time police officer and part time night vision dealer. I will make an educated guess that more than one persons posting on this <br>
board has been &quot;In jail&quot; once for something, like driving when they had a few too many drinks after a Christmas party. Does that mean that person is a lousy individual who defrauds his customers, beats his wife, and kicks his dog? No. <br>
<br>
XXXXX you have been very helpful to me on several occassions. I hope you are not offended by this post but you were totally out of line to post that statement without backing it up with proof. (XXXXX you were right) <br>

The person i sold it to sent me an email from him where he was stating that he controlled the PAQ market. What a jerk. I sold it for $500 less than he was offering just so he couldn't rip someone else off.<br>
Oh that story of needing money is probably crap too. He has been placing ads all over looking for Beta C-mags. I guess so he can jack those prices up also. <br>

			<P></center>Last summer's eBay auction with the 1&quot; hole in the objective lens housing. Mr. LeMarte, that was a dent<br>
in the housing not a hole &amp; you are stretching the truth about it. It looked like it had been kicked across the parking lot, it was used, what did you want for $ 850.00 ? Your money was returned, postage &amp; handling included. <br>
This recent past deal with the 7 Alpha's was my decision to renig, it was a bad business decision but I cant change what has been done. Your check was returned &amp; postage was refunded. The dealer you &amp; I both get PVS-4 housings, and other night vision equipment from needed the Alpha goggles to test tubes with, being within the same town and close friends with this dealer I chose to sell him the Alpha's because it would be in my best interests.<br>
Mike LeMarte, you've never did anything for me, you didnt even contact me after I asked and called you on several occassions about 3rd. Gen PVS-4 tubes, you always sold them to other vendors first. I'm not holding that against you, it's business.<br>
Mike LeMarte, If I burned you then let's never do business with one another again, let's not even think about it. I burned the bridge between us and such is life..<br>
Lanny Leonard's allegation that I was in jail was false. You &amp; I both know who made that allegation, it's no big deal to me cause it was false to begin with.<br>
Mike, if you feel burned by the Alpha deal so be it, just remember I never DIDNT REFUND YOU YOUR MONEY, you always were returned your funds...<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 10, 2002, 5:30 PM<BR> from IP address 216.190.254.49</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026347451'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

 I have gotten a couple PVS 4 tubes from Mike LeMarte ove rth elast year or so and they were great good price and good tubes no problems hope to deal with him again some time. <br>
 Two weeks ago me and Terry of Surplus-Ltd@ev1.net agreed on four new PVS 4 rail grabber mounts i have for 400.00. I turned down three other dealer because i promised them to him (man is only as good as his word, dad aways told me) boxed them up and waited for him to get his address to me. After a week of me holding them for him, he mailed me and his words were &quot;I'll pass&quot; its really no big deal but i felt it was a little unprofessional for a man who does this for a living. <br>
 Like i said just my 2 cents take it for what its worth.   <br>

I offered this guy (container, as he was going by then), a offer of $1000.00 for two Beta mags he had for sale. I had bought two others together on AR15.com a week before for that price that were in the boxes and even loaded full with SS109, so I considered it a fair offer.<br>
<br>
Here is my offer and his reply:<br>
<br>
______________________________________________________<br>
<br>
MY OFFER:<br>
<br>
I am looking to purchase 2 or 3 Beta Mags. Can you sell them for $500 each at that quantity?<br>
I can Pay Pal you the money today (6/11) if you email me back by 12:30 am (eastern time)<br>
Otherwise I will check my messages tomorrow before 10:00 am.<br>
<br>

Baaahahhahhah!!!!!!!!!!! $ 500.00 each ? Baaahahhahhah!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I just sold all 6 of my REFURBISHED in the wrapper Beta's and my 4<br>
new Beta's, just the magazine &amp; dust cover only for $ 600.00 each<br>
+ shipping to one customer.<br>
<br>
You guys didnt think I would sell them did you ??? I kept telling<br>
ya'll my price was $ 600.00 &amp; $ 700.00 each, but ya'll wouldnt<br>

<br>
This guy wanted a discount too for buying 10 at a time, I said go<br>

<br>
_____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Is it just me or could he have just politely declined my offer?<br>
I thought Container and Surplus LTD where one in the same even before I read the thread only because both of these people gave me the same nasty replies to my emails. Of course, I would have lots of different names if I were him too.<br>

			<P></center>&quot;Beta Mags don't come from the Beta Co. or anywhere else new in the box loaded up with ammo so someone had to load that ammo into those magazines.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did not say they were unopened, just in the original boxes (with serial #'s and pre 94 stickers).<br>
Of course, they did not come from Beta mag company with ammo. The guy who sold them to me said they were loaded with green tip and he would send them loaded or unloaded, whatever I preferred, I can always use ammo so I had them ship loaded and I thought that was pretty nice of the guy.<br>
<br>
&quot;my idea is NOT to sell them to folks/trolls that frequent the weapon boards on a daily basis&quot;<br>
<br>
So now I'm a troll? Because I frequent weapon boards and buy things from those boards?<br>
First of all what does that make you? Do you not frequent weapon boards?<br>
Secondly,If it weren't for those TROLLS you would not make near as much money, but why am I not surprised that you would insult your own customer base.<br>
<br>
&quot;IF YOU DONT LIKE MY PRICE LOOK ELSEWHERE, pretty simple.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, I thought making an offer for what I had paid for the last two would be fair. If I new your above stated policy I would not have made the offer.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just let you understand that it was my price or hit the road pal &amp; YOU WERE OFFENDED BY THAT.... Soft skin&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, I was offended, and I think most other prospective customers would be too. <br>
Obviously, I am not alone in this opinion, and this is just one small discussion board. <br>
I bet if I did a search on some of the other boards I would find the same thing there, but since I haven't, I will just have to go by my own experience and of the experiences of others on this board. I'm sure you also have a fan club but they must be getting one heck of a deal to put up with your attitude.<br>
I have bought quite a few things, both in person, and on the internet, and have never met anyone with such a nasty attitude.<br>

Please do me a favor  and stick to one name on the boards so that when I am &quot;TROLLING&quot; I will not make the mistake of buying something from you.<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

			<P></center>This Terry guy says, &quot;If you don't like my price....&quot; and goes on about &quot;trolls on the weapons boards......&quot;<br>
So, I have a post on &quot;one of the weapons boards&quot; for some AN-PVS-2s that were recently traded to me by a local PD.  They are absolutely NIB, with all the correct containers, all serial number match (even the one on the cardboard shipping box) and out of the blue comes the following email from Surplus-ltd@evl.net:<br>
<br>
 Phil,<br>
  <br>
dont take this in a derogatory way but Springfield Armory is having a tough time sellling the scopes you are offering in a reconditioned state for $ 599.95<br>
I know you say new in box but do you realize how old the technology is, you can almost see better with the naked eye.<br>
I'm sure there are a few collectors that would want one.<br>
Good luck...<br>
<br>
<br>
   The man is so straight forward and honest in all his dealings?  Why can't he even sign his real name?<br>
   BTW, I still have a few left at $550 each or $500 for 3 or more<br>
   What a piece of work.<br>

			<P></center>one is a 1x head mountable mono and the other is a fixed objective 2.25x/4x rifle scope.<br>
<br>
personally i would take the 17 over the 14. eventhough the 14 allows for head mounting the 17 wont get a burn spot from your aiming device. for hands free 7's will do fine. i dont think i could shoot much more than 100 yards with a 14 and my reflex2. but a 17 should let you shoot much farther.<br>
<br>
just my .02 but i am biased towards deticated rifle scopes and i just adore the 17 eventhough i've not had a chance to use one, i justlike the idea behind its design.<br>

Nice trick!!!! Buy ITT new units, pull the new tubes and replace with old ones and sell them 250 less than the next guy.The problem is mine died and I mailed it back to ITT since it was under warrenty and found out.I don't take many chances anymore for a few hundred bucks.It already cost me nearly 2000$ once before.It is hard to tell you is honest and who is not is the problem we all face buying NV. <P><center><i>Posted on Jul 11, 2002, 3:59 PM<BR> from IP address 24.117.27.48</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026428387'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

I will be checking on that anyway, so will let you know. There will be/is a weaver mount version,  also there will be/is a crosshair reticle version, and possibly a mil-dot version coming. <br>

			<P></center>A vast majority of night vision scopes are made to fit on Weaver 7/8 dovetail scope mounts. If you have Weaver mounts on your rifle than all that is usually needed is a long or extended weaver type dovetail rail which will mount on top of your scope mounts and is necessary to give you the propper eye relief of a night vision scope (lets you move the scope back further). Depending on how fancy you want to get with your mounts and rails it could cost an additional $60 to $250 for these mounts.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 9, 2002, 6:00 PM<BR> from IP address 24.160.139.235</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026262841'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>That question is like asking what is the best caliber for hunting. Unless you are in a big rush to get a night vision scope, I would suggest you do a little homework and learn a bit more about night vision rifle scopes. It can be compared to car shopping. You must have a pretty good idea of what you want (Chevy,Ford,etc) and how much you want to spend. Do you want new or used? Do you want a U.S. made or imported? In your case I assume you want something for varmits or hogs since that is about all you can hunt legally after dark in some states. How far will you be shooting also has to be considered. Most but not all have a military type inverted &quot;V&quot; or chevron as an aiming device in the scope. Some may need an external illuminator if not built in. If you can make a list of what you will use it for, how far you expect to shoot etc. then many folks on this board can make some recommendations or suggestions to you.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 9, 2002, 7:09 PM<BR> from IP address 24.160.139.235</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026266971'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I just listed my 242 on ebay last night starting at $770.Thats a bargin of a life time,but I just bought another 343 sight from USNV with 64lp/mm tube.I already have a 343 with 51lp/mm tube and yes there is a noticeable difference in performance between the two scopes.I bought the 242 as a loaner for when my poor hunting buddys come over to shoot.Now they will use my old 343 scope instead.The 242 is makes a brighter picture than my 343s on starlight nights but has half the clearness and more static in the FOV.I guess thats the 28lp/mm  25mm tube compared to 51-64lp/mm 3rd gen tube. But its also half the price to!!!! Over all the 242 will kill most game to a minium of 100yards on a dark night and much greater distances with some moon light or along a edge of a large town from the light from city lights.The only condition I could not get a shootable picture was with overcast starlight skies.There was to much static in the picture even when I turned up the gain. Of coarse this was with green summer time grass and tall weeds.I think all night vision looks alot better in the winter with dead grass and no tree leaves to shadow every thing.Well if anyone is interested you can email me on it.I have a guy here in my town looking at it tonight to.<P><center><i>Posted on Jul 10, 2002, 3:38 PM<BR> from IP address 24.117.27.48</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1026340734'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

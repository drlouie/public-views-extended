			<P></center>I have a few questions all the forum members, and hoped you guys could give me some advice.<br>
<br>
I do alot of posting to the list (ask Lanny!), and need some help with my night vision dilema!<br>
<br>
I went night varmint hunting this past weekend with my Swiss Jumelle 72 binocs (Fero51) and my PVS-502.<br>
<br>
Both worked very well, but their were tons of clouds, and the moon was just a sliver, like maybe 1/10 of a moon (almost nothing!).  The binocs worked very well (since they have their own IR spot), and the 6x maginifcation is definitely a plus!  I watched a few racoons, and a few opossums mess around about 100-150 yards out.  Then a bobcat showed up, and I planned on taking him.  My 502 has been such a good scope, but with the cloud cover and zero moon, it just wouldn't cut it.  At only 3x, and with it being SO dark, I could barely make out the outline.  I could have probably made the shot if I had to, but I don't like not being able to clearly see my target (thru the weapon scope), so I decided not to shoot, and just to watch.  I normally shoot 1.5&quot; five-shot groups with my 502, under a slightly cloudy sky, with 1/4-1/2 moon.<br>
But this clouds and the no moon conditions really shocked me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have seen all the posts on the 242, 341, 441, etc. Call me old fashioned, but I have seen them up close and still prefer the PVS-4.  The PVS-4 is just better made, in my opinion, and just that ~ an opinion.  I am not knocking any of the guys on this list, like USNV, Excalibur, Stano, NAIT, etc. I like those guys! But I have a warm place in my heart for mil-issue items. Which led me to think that if my 502 breaks anytime in the future, where will that leave me?  Do you have any spare 18mm tubes for the 502? Not many people do, and the parts are very hard to come by, correct?<br>
<br>
Now, the PVS-4, on the other hand, has a wide variety of parts available, and replacement Gen II tubes can be had for $75-$150 all day long, correct?  And other parts, larger cadioptic objective lenses, etc?  Would the PVS-4 with 7X cadioptic lens still fit on the AR-15 carry handle?  I assume it would, since the scope is way up in the air, but drawback would be the massive weight of the scope, correct?<br>
<br>
Anyway, with the scenario described above (very cloudy, no moon), would the step up to a nice Gen II PVS-4 give me any advantages (in 3X or even in 7X) at all?  Would the scene be brighter?  More clarity?  Remember, you are talking to a guy that has NEVER looked thru a Gen II scope of any kind at night, real world.  Only thru pin hole covers at gun shows have I seen any gen II or III stuff, which is a worthless experience in itself.  Looking thru them at night, real world is a MUST!<br>
I have heard that the reticle on the PVS-4 is not very good.  I like the reticle on my 502, is the PVS-4 similar? better? Worse? What's the difference?<br>
<br>
Also, how much better is a Gen II PVS-4 versus my Gen I+ PVS-502?  Will I get a &quot;Holy ****!  This is much better than my 502!&quot; reaction when I look thru the PVS-4 in Gen II?  Any real workd comparisons between my 502 and the PVS-4 would be great!  Brighter? Clarity? Under terrible conditions?  How is the reticle adjust on them?  Works like my 502?  Etc, these kind of things would be helpful to know.<br>
<br>
Anyway, long story short, I am thinking of selling my beloved 502 (gulp! I love this scope!).  <br>
<br>
After I hear your reply, I will decide whether to sell it on the forum, try to incorporate a trade for what you recommend (PVS-4 hopefully), or ask my Dad if he is interested in buying it for himself.  Either way, the scope is in excellent shape, with an extremely nice tube, Military case, FAL mount, AR-15 carry handle mount, spare batteries, Allen wrenches, lens paper.  I would almost want to keep it just to have it for my FAL, but money is tight.  I would hope to get the upper end of the price spectrum ($600) for it, since it is a very nice scope.  Which means in order to get a COMPLETE PVS-4 setup, with extra nice tube (including Mil hard case, soft case, wrenches, manual, lens brush, AA batt. adapter, etc.) I would need another $600, correct?  or more like $700?  I guess it would depend on who I bought it from.  Anyway, can you tell me how much a nice one with all accessories would cost?<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for listening, and please give me a nice long dissertation on what my options are.<br>
<br>
I just can't afford a Gen III at this time, and probably wouldn't want anything except a PVS-4 Gen III (I know, coating issues versus performance...) or a Raptor (or maybe an older mil-Aquilla Gen II or III). <br>
<br>
Thanks Again,<br>

			<P></center>Hi all.  I'm trying to sell my personal Litton PVS-7D and my Gen 3 PVS-4.<br>
<br>
The 7D comes with headset, soft case, forehead pads, lens paper and lithium batteries.  The tube is clean with no visible blemishes or spots.  This unit is in perfect condition with pristine optics and a fresh Nitrogen purge.<br>
<br>
The PVS-4 has a Gen 3 tube in it with a datecode of Nov. 00.  There are no spots or blemishes on the tube.  The optics are perfect and it also has a fresh Nitrogen purge.  It comes with a ARMS-20 lever action Weaver rail mount, AR-15 mount, daylight cover, hard plastic case and soft case, AA battery adapter (2), shuttered eyeguard and regular eyeguard, and Lithium AA batteries.<br>
<br>
I'm asking $3,000 for the 7D and $4,000 for the PVS-4.  Those prices are negotiable.  I am not going to list them on E-bay until I have exhausted other possibilities.  I would like to get a Cashier's check for payment, but I'm also willing to use an escrow service if the buyer desires it, or I can even pay Chris at USNV to play the intermediary if he's willing to do it.<br>
<br>
The reason that I'm selling these units is that my vehicle blew up the transmission yesterday and I need the money to pay for the repairs.  That does not mean that I will sell these units dirt cheap, it just means that I am willing to consider any reasonable offer.<br>
<br>
Interested buyers can e-mail me at the address on this message, or call me at (510) 624-1294 or (510) 299-0733.<br>
<br>
I have worked with Lanny for a while and he knows me fairly well, so ask him if you're unsure about any of this.  He will vouch for me.<br>
<br>
Thank you.

			<P></center>The 7D he is selling is an original Litton unit, with a very very sweet tube.  Tube is original to goggle, and it is excellent.  The gen 3 tube in the PVS-4 is also an excellent tube.  I have not seen the sight, but would expect it to be in very good shape knowing Doc. <P><center><i>Posted on Apr 16, 2002, 6:41 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.190.41</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1019007689'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>that site was seemingly someone's impression of what really was.  They stated gen 4 was unfilmed technology, which is not really accurate either.  The unfilmed tube process has been offered by Litton on gen 2 and 3 for a while now, just not to us commercially.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 15, 2002, 4:05 AM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.193</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018868734'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I have a new 14 delta, and the the mount where you snap in the monocular into the headmount is just full of play. When I tip my head to either side, the monocular falls to the side reducing my picture by probably 50%! Even walking over rough terrain makes me have to keep my hand on the monocular to keep it lined up with my eye. My headmount is secure on my head, it's that slopply interface between monocular and mount that is PMO. I will go into the hills tonight and try to keep it tight with rubber bands, but I am hoping someone has had a similar problem, and can help me out.<br>

			<P></center>Hello everyone,<br>
A long time ago I heard it mentioned that you could replace the red laser thingamajiggy(emitter,diode?) in a commercial laser with an infrared one in order to make a low cost aiming laser/pointer for a rifle. Would anyone care to share that knowledge again, and what type of performance would we be talking about, i.e.- how tight a beam for how far?<br>
Thanks again,<br>

In theory it should be possible to do providing you can find an IR laser that will fit.  Most of the IR lasers are designed for CD-RW and sensing apps, the reds for DVD and laser pointers, hence the packages may not match.  The optics should be close enough to accomidate the new longer wavelength.  IR laser diodes will have performance equal to or better than the red ones (they have been made since the early 70's).  IR types are more efficent, more light per mA provided, so it will be &quot;brighter&quot; than the red one.  Like all semiconductor opto devices they are current driven once the threshold voltage is reached (1.3Volt for IR, 1.8V for red).  You should be able to simply replace the diode with no changes to the circuit board since the laser power supply board regulates current not voltage, both devices will operate in the 30 to 40mA drive range.  The IR diode will have 3 terminals consisting of: the laser diode, the feedback detector and either a common anode or cathode for the two devices in the package.  The red diode will likely have only two terminals (anode and cathode, no feedback diode) so you will only need to properly hook up two leads of the IR diode (the feedback detector terminal is for regulating the output in sensitive applications like CD-RWs).  Checking the IR diode manfuacturers data sheet will give you the pin out, a multimeter will show you how the red diode is hooked up (the Anode is the arrow, the Cathode is the bar, positive &quot;travels&quot; in the direction of the arrow).  Here's some of the manufacturers of laser diodes:<br>
<br>
Japanese: ROHM, Sharp, Hitachi, Panasonic, Matshu****a, Nichia, etc.<br>
<br>
www.xxxxx.co.jp (Japanese web site, many are in english for Singapore, etc)<br>
www.xxxxx.com (US web site)<br>
<br>
European: Philips, Telefunken<br>
Taiwan: Kingbright, Lite on, Arima<br>
<br>
US: Optodiode, Hewlett Packard (HP)<br>
<br>
It's highly possible that your red laser was sourced out of China and might be one of a kind.  Keep in mind that your eyes retna are very easy to damage with IR (write once, read many) since the pupil won't close, can't see the IR to react and you won't know if you created a IR searchlight or a candle.  Also keep in mind that you don't what to use your expensive NV to align the new unit (most IR lasers are prefocused since they are made for very specific applications).  If you don't have one of the IR viewers (like Edmund Scientific sells) then you may want to get a phoshper target (Edmund sells them, in the old days electronic parts houses sold credit card sized units (made with tiny square of material from Kodak) to check remote controls, ask to check under the dust on the shelves behind the counter, a couple of bucks).  All laser diode devices are highly sensitive to static electricity, with damage levels as low as 5 Volts (vs. the 10 Kilovolt lightning bolts you generate walking on carpeting).  You need to use a wrist ground strap (like the ones in the computer repair tool kits, under a buck).  These straps use a 1 Meg Ohm resistor in series to prevent you from getting electrocuted, so don't ground yourself directly.<br>
<br>
So if you find a diode that fits, don't blow it up and blind yourself you did good.  If not you never heard of me...<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 15, 2002, 1:43 PM<BR> from IP address 204.144.142.120</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018903385'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>IR Lasers</b><br>by Michael Brown<P></center>Swapping a laser diode(as opposed to swapping the whole module) is inadvisable.You probably will damage the diode with heat or ESD (electrostatic discharge).It will either fry it instantly, or reduce its life.Also, who knows if the old driver circuit will keep it happy?Infared diode modules are the way to go...and they are easily found online.Take your old unit apart and simply order a module in IR to replace it.1 to 5mw will be enough...&lt;1 mw would also work...and is essentially eye safe(1 to 5mw isnt too hazardous anyhow).Beam quality will be good enough for a 5 inch dot size at 400yards with a cheap unit.Tiny dots at long range involve better(more costly)optics,and bigger module size...which probably wont fit your unit.I have seen 100 dollar infared beamshots for sale.Good enough for typical use.<br>

Turning the unit off overnight helped a little, but it was still noticable, (esp since I know where I did it). I then remembered a tip posted buy BH a little while ago, and it worked.  I can't find it even though I know where to look.  You basically go into a dark room and turn the gain down till the unit starts to speckle.  Then you leave it on for about 24 hrs in an absolutly dark place with the lens cap off.  I have heard of other methods and variations but this worked for me. Thanks again BH.<br>

			<P></center>Code-1 is right, the 260B is a blemished unit as oppossed to the 260 which is still subject to blemishises. I have seen some B units and they are pretty spotty and can be a good deal depending on the price. I remember onal a $200.00 difference when they were first released and it did not seem worth it at the time to promote them. <br>

			<P></center>Thanks, Chris.  When I bought my 260, I wasn't even aware of the fact there was such a thing as a 260B.  I'm in the process of trying to sell them, and someone asked me if they were a 260B.  Evidently, they are the 260 model, as there is no &quot;B&quot; in the model number.  I was concerned that I may have been &quot;taken&quot; by the place where I purchased them (a very reputable outdoor outfitter).  Good to know that they are not the &quot;blem&quot; model...<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>What factors affect field of view?</b><br>by MJ<P></center>I have different NVD's Gen 2 and 3 which use C-mount lenses. I have noticed a vast difference in FOV between various models. For example I can take two different NVD's That use 1X C-mount lenses, have similiar or identical sized eyepiece openings and same sized diameter glass aperature over the intensifier tubes yet when I compare them one give a nice wide field of view that make walking and optics functions simple while the other is like looking through a cardboard paper towel tube. I can interchange c-mount lenses of equal or higher magnification all day long with the same results. Why is this? I figure there must be some feature of the tube housing or how the tube is mounted in the housing that affects this. Ideas anyone?  <P><center><i>Posted on Apr 13, 2002, 1:58 AM<BR> from IP address 4.47.225.37</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018688316'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>i want to know the answer too...</b><br>by turner<P></center>someone! please answer.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 13, 2002, 10:56 AM<BR> from IP address 217.224.243.5</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018720584'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>If all of the nvd's you spoke of have c-mount lenses then you should be unscrewing the entire lens and replacing it with another one. If lenses are stacked they can reduce the field of view, tunnel effect. If adapters are used possibly the same thing. C-mount lenses usually have the focal length printed on them (25mm 50mm 75mm) for example. 25mm focal length lenses are considered 1X if nvd has an 18mm image tube. You didn't say what all of your different devices have. Higher powers (longer focal length) have smaller fields of view. Be more specific about the models of nvd and the lens specs.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 13, 2002, 11:46 AM<BR> from IP address 65.229.118.103</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018723611'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Will sell for $2250 or any reasonable offer!! No don't offer me $1000 bucks for it, email me at Jaco212@dropzone.com for any further details on the unit. It was purchased from a reputable dealer about 18 months ago and i need money for skydiving this summer! Thanks for looking.

			<P></center>Just got this scope and have several questions. Instructions say it mounts on standard weaver 7/8 mount. I have 10 rifles, some with weaver 7/8 2 piece bases that are too far apart for this scope to mount on. Is there a generic (universal) weaver rail that I need to get for the base? Most rifles are bolt action from custom 220 Swift to Sako 300 Win Mag. Also the instructions say removable IR light, the only thing that removes is the lens cover to the IR. Any help appreciated, Tom <P><center><i>Posted on Apr 12, 2002, 12:05 PM<BR> from IP address 24.160.139.235</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018638305'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Mount etc</b><br>by

			<P></center>There is a weaver rail extension available from various sources, I believe Brownells, and other vendors like that.  It basically slides over your bases and locks on with set screws and then your sight mounts to it, as it is basically a picatinny rail on top.   I think it raises the sight less than 1/2&quot;.  Sorry I don't know where exactly to send you. Try Ron at Aurora Tactical, he might know for sure.  <br>
  As for the IR,  the whole little unit should unscrew, and there is a cap/plug to cover the hole.  That makes the sight legal where you can't use artificial lights to hunt.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 12, 2002, 1:25 PM<BR> from IP address 216.37.159.119</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018643119'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Gen V to come?</b><br>by franco<P></center>I've been talking to a friend that is into high-tech optoelectronics, and we've been discussing what is Gen V and if there would be a Gen V after all.<br>
Well, his opinion (and it seems it cannot be nothing more than an &quot;opinion&quot;...) is that the next Gen tube will be made with an interesting integration technology, which creates almost &quot;solid-state&quot; tubes.<br>
In detail (what I can remember...), the front portion of the tube would be pretty much as it is now, with either gated or non-gated PWR (and filmless or filmed tech), and with the actual vacuum spacing between the the PhotoK and MCP; the difference would be in the MCP, which will integrate the phosphor screen.<br>
Essentially, instead of having a continuous layer of phosphor sitting on a flat glass (or FO) separated by a vacuum, at the end of each channel of the MCP, a tiny quantity of phosphor would be deposited.<br>
Actually, the phosphor is deposited in a second MCP-like disk (it can even be directly the FO output bundle), bonded on a insulator layer and this is again bonded on the MCP, making in fact a monolithic &quot;sandwich&quot; which allows for the differentiated power supply.<br>
The technology is actually borrowed from IC silicon processing.<br>
There are more details he told me, such as a very thin aluminum &quot;filter&quot; between the phosphor and channel, almost transparent to electrons, but reflective to the light emitted from the phosphor (thus preventing any photon getting back at the PhotoK) and other stuff I cant remember.<br>
Wish I taped everything.<br>
Having single &quot;pixel-like&quot; phosphor dots that light up separately will dramatically improve resolution, contrast, halo  and S/N (?).<br>
<br>
Does anybody have more info, and maybe tell me if it is bogus or for real????<br>
It did sound like it made a LOT of sense, though.<br>
<br>

			<P></center>1) I thought this was supposed to be a night vision forum, not a forum for immature play, and inflamitory statements or personal attacks. If you have a problem, with a vendor, talk to the vendor. Mistakes happen and the vendor will either satisfy you or not - but give them a chance. While it might be appropriate to post good or bad experiences with a vendor so others have the benefit of your experience, honestly stating your case rather than &quot;flaming&quot; others will get you further.<br>
<br>
2) As to USNV, they are kind enough to provide this forum. I am a USNV customer and have been very pleased with thier customer service to date. <br>
<br>
3)I make my most recient NV purchase at a trade show and thus had the opportunity to look at NV products from many vendors. At that partucular show, I think USNV had the highest quality product and offered it at a reasonable price, so I made my purchase accordingly. <br>
<br>
4) Keep in mind the nature of modern tubes - most are only inspected in detail and graded by the tube manufacturer. Other than function testing, many NV product manufacturers rely on the original testing and grading to keep costs down. NV purchases are best made in person or if this is not possible, from a seller with a suitable return policy. Know the grading system used for the tubes, request a tube of a particular grade, and ask to have your purchase &quot;hand picked&quot; if there is something of particular importance to you that grading cannot guarantee.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 12, 2002, 1:06 PM<BR> from IP address 65.100.182.209</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018641983'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>Chris, I absolutely agree with your policy on deleting inappropriate very angry comments, as long as you are consistent. Somehow negative feedback on USNV disappears (like today) in the matter of hours, but never mind supercilious (the best polite word I could find) remarks by Ping &amp; Co. about ATN. One thing I unconditionally agree with you on is authors intelligence level. I personally continually enjoy Pings comments during my lunch. How can anyone miss marvels like haveing, thay and my personal favorite payed? By the way, for what it worth, according to our customer service rep, reason for the return of the Day/Night was that at 12X the scope would not focus at a distance shorter then 15 feet. What do you know: every ten years or so you get a sniper that needs an optical device to shoot himself in the left foot (the best polite application I could find). <br>

Pin at least stated some sort of factual info, even if he was a bit angry and upset.

You should know me better than that. I did not delete the derogatory remarks made by this person about my company. I only deleted his post that attacked an individual with very poor language. I have been aware of Ping's remarks and I have not felt that he has been anything but upset. <br>

Not send the unit back and give them a chance to make it right?I find this story hard to belive because I have bought to many Items from USNV and find them to be the best service I have found in ten years of buying NV products. Yes,I belive you could have bought a set of PVS-7 goggles with a few spots. The are more tubes with spots than clean ones out there in the market. No one will guarantee you a near spotless tube unless you buy a delta unit. Not even Excalibur!! I had a set of their PVS-7 Prime(64lp/mm) goggles for 3 years and they were super nice,but not spotless unless you were to blind to see spots.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 15, 2002, 5:52 PM<BR> from IP address 24.116.29.56</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018918321'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>All tubes are different, but very few are actually perfect spot free.  I have had several that you could see NO spots,  and none were recorded on the tube sheet.  The omni-specs require less than a certain diameter spot, with various numbers being allowed in the 3 areas of the tube.  The spot size varies with the area, and these specs vary by tube type as well.  Probably all tubes have spots, but some you cannot see with the naked eye,  while others that can be seen do not interfere with performance required by the military, and are therefore acceptable.  Only civilians get all worked up about spots.  I have had some beautiful little used scopes that had a few spots, and they just would not sell to many people, simply because I stated there were some spots.  They did not interfere with an otherwise perfect device in the least.  Where and how big they are is the main thing,  and of course if there are 75 in the center of the tube, that would not be nice.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 13, 2002, 5:54 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.193</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018745679'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Life Time of Image tubes</b><br>by George<P></center>Very interesting forum. I hope it'll continue this way. Here is the question which I hope will bring some attention of knowledgeable guys. Some people saying that, for instance, gen.3 tubes, US made have life time 10000 hours, vs. Russian made: 5000 hours, even less. As far as I know, none of NVD have timer or any other device which enables to count how many hours this device was used, and I think even more important of how it was used, how much abuse it took.<br>
Or in other words, how to transfer this term in years of usage which warrants manufacturer.

			<P></center>As for life expectancy, I believe that is minimum life based on normal expected usage of the particular tube.  Gen 3 being 10,000 hours minimum before the tube actually breaks down from &quot;normal&quot; use,  which would be viewing during the night, with a minimum of staring at car headlights or extremely bright sources.  Of course there is no hour meter attached, but you could do the math of how many nights of looking around for a couple of hours would equal 10K.  Abuse such as bright light viewing would tend to shorten the life,  but each incident would be unique as each tube is, so how much life is lost cannot really be known.  10K being the minimum,  I don't know if anyone knows what the maximum is, that I have heard anyway.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 11, 2002, 8:20 PM<BR> from IP address 199.224.71.73</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018581653'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>I'm looking for a copy (or photocopy) of the manual too.<br>
<br>
I recently purchased the bino manufactured in 1983. Ex-UK MoD. Works fine and in original carryinmg case. <br>
Mine has the Corporal's name on the case and his Unit - 1 Troop 39FD. It's probably been out in the middle-east, as it had a light coating of dust on the outside of the case and a scrap of paper with arabic writing on<br>
 it. Also in the case was a petrol claim form and the amauond is in Deutschmarks - so it's been to Germany too.<br>
<br>
Under the foam lining was the Quality Control Test Sheet.<br>
(If anyone wants a copy I'll scan it.)<br>
<br>

of cheaters who sell 1-Gen devices as 2-Gen,<br>

i shot a SKS with a PVS4, WOW. talk about cooking tubes, that crapy powder in russian ammo just plain sucked for night shooting.<br>

alot of it depends on the type of powder, barrel length and caliber. i have never used night vision on my FAL but would like to sometime. i'm not very optomistic about this cuse its a post ban model with a muzzel brake that vents a blast upward. not a good place to go when using NV scopes!!

			<P></center>Guys,<br>
<br>
You do make a number of valid points about the NVS7-2, but you are wrong about the tube life.<br>
The Newcon version of this goggle has a new (not surplus) Gen 2+ tube that has an MTBF of over 7,500 hours, which does make it good value, even when compared to US kit within the same class.<br>
<br>
Though certainly not up to Gen 3 standards, it can compete with US Gen 2 - both the Royal Navy and Japanese DF have just adopted this device, after extensive trials which featured similar spec devices from Litton etc. So when you compare like with like, it fairs pretty well ! There does seem to be a big disparity in price from dealer to dealer, which is something that should be addressed. Here in EU, we get hit with large import and VAT (tax) fees, which does put the price up a lot, when compared with US domestic prices.<br>
<br>

<br>
Those PDF manuals are over 3 years old at this stage (if you look at the front page of the site, it says that they are currently updating it) and so the manuals precede the newer versions of the NVS7-2, which now comes in three different Gen2+ variants (all of which have the tube that I referred to fitted) - NVS7-2, NVS7-2 HD, and NVS7-2 WA (wide angle, 60 degree fov).<br>
<br>
You will note that neither of the two above are in pdf format either.<br>
<br>
If it wasn`t from the &quot;horses mouth&quot;, and I was`nt sure of my facts, I wouldn`t have posted ! <br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Re: NVS7-2</b><br>by Ross<P></center>If the Royal Navy and Japanese are using them I bet they are paying under $1000.00 per unit. I don't think they would be going through some dealer and his mark up. Plus with volume buying they would be getting a goggle cheaper than what normal people would have to pay. But, if I were under night fire i'd rather be wearing a PVS7 GenIII rather than a NVS7 2 or 3.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 9, 2002, 11:47 PM<BR> from IP address 65.70.221.189</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018421271'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>When Military organisations etc tender for equipment, their requirements are specification driven first, and price second - thats the way it works.<br>
If after the trials, some products are found to be better then others, they will usually pass the tender to the company that offers the best maintenance package pro rata overall price. Your comment about &quot;middle men&quot; is off - it was a UK based distributor who got the Navy contract, and a Japanes one who got the Army one, and i would imagine that prices were very similar to retail prices.<br>
<br>
PS, when the tracer was hitting the bank above our heads, it was not a set of NVGs being used, but rather a Pilkington KITE weapon sight !(made in UK but in use with many armies throughout the world.)<br>

With that said I won't be buying one because it is to close in price to a 3rd gen mono google or something else 3rd gen here in the USA.For some one out of the country or stuck at the 2000$ mark they would not be a bad choice.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 10, 2002, 3:37 PM<BR> from IP address 24.116.29.56</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018478247'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

Appartently, they are now called ATMc MO3-2.  I was going to purchase one and wondered if anyone had any objections or suggestions.  The asking price is $435 and this is a brand new (supposedly) Generation II unit.  Thanks for your time and have a great day.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 8, 2002, 5:35 PM<BR> from IP address 207.77.140.2</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018312500'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Tasco  = Garbage ( usually )</b><br>by Sid<P></center>Tasco have never retailed a day or night scope that I would use for anything other than a doorstop, apart from the SS10X42 &quot; Sniper &quot; which is pretty good value even at UK prices. <br>
<br>
I would regard any NV gear they sell with extreme suspicion. It is going to be Russian Gen 1, which has it's place in the great scheme of things, but not at the price Tasco are likely to be asking for it....<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 8, 2002, 5:54 PM<BR> from IP address 62.254.0.7</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018313678'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

			<P></center>This used to be a good little scope, but within the past 18 months AMT have been using &quot;D&quot; grade tubes (probably saving the rest for the patriot)which means your FOV will look very dirty, and sensitivity will probably be way down.<br>
<br>
I would give this device a good day and night check, to check FOV cleanliness and photoresponse, before I parted with any cash !<br>

			<P></center>To be honest, I have not seen the Patriot in a night test, so I cannot comment on its overall performance, but overall build quality does seem to be quite good.<br>
<br>
The concept of the device is very good, but we do not sell this model because the overall system price is very high - most people will still prefer dedicated goggles, handheld or weapon-sight, and the retail price of the complete patriot is so high that you could nearly buy all three disciplines separately any way !.<br>

			<P></center>Sorry for the innocent, uninformed request, but I'm looking for recommendations for an NV application:<br>
<br>
I'm into a little hobby called Airsoft (basically MilSim games with 1:1 replicas of real steel guns that shoot 6mm BB's...sorta like paintball, but more MilSim based and mature).  Anyway, sometimes we play at night, and I'm looking for a good NV scope or viewer that can be gun-mounted.  Currently, I have a Aries MK258 scope that isn't bad, but I'd like to upgrade a bit...especially after looking through a friend's Litton Gen3.  Magnification isn't really needed since engagements occur 100 yds and closer.<br>
What would you recommend for someone who would like to get up into a Gen2/3 while hopefully staying below $1500?  Would it even be worthwhile upgrading from the MK258 Gen 1+ to Gen2, or should I just save the money for a Gen3?<br>
<br>

			<P></center>A NV scope too large will add to the weight significantly, and the larger concern is taking a BB in the front lens at a closer range which would be bad obviously.<br>
To address this, I've custom-cut Lexan covers for my Reflex-type daytime sights, which have worked well, so I was hoping to do the same for the NV scope.<br>
<br>
Thanks so far for your recommendations!  <br>

			<P></center>Hmm, If I remember correctly the person I talked to at ITT back in the summer said the filmless was only sold to U.S. military. Not that I can afford one anyway, but I did ask. :) <br>
<br>
I also seem to remember being told the performance of the unfilmed dropped off from the beginning, and that filmed maintained performance more often to the end of the rating MTBF. I could be wrong on these things.<br>
<br>
Here are some images comparing filmed and unfilmed from Litton's web site.<br>

<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>What image intensifier tubes work in daylight?</b><br>by Ken Doe<P></center>I've also heard that unfilmed tubes can safely be used in daylight! <br>
<br>
I assume that the gated power supplies used in unfilmed tubes vary the duty cycle to control gain. <br>
In daylight, the gain is  cranked way down.<br>
<br>
Could this trick be used in filmed tubes? <br>
<br>
I wonder how ITT squeezes the extra performance out of its Pinnacletubes? <br>
Do they use ion barriers that are less then 100 atoms thick or do the Photo Cathodes have better sensitivity?  (both of these?)<br>
<br>
I understand halo is a function of how close you can get the Micro-Channel-Plate to the Photo-Cathode. <br>
Do unfilmed tubes have less halo because without the ion barrier, the MCP can be placed closer to the PC? <br>
Does 100 atoms really make that much difference? <br>
<br>

			<P></center>I think pinnacle tubes are filmed. Advertised as long life anyway. Indium Alloy GaAs. Also Indium Gallium liquid mirror telescopes. They make some pretty wild photoresponse claims. Pretty much like image stabilizing optics. They just use magic and voodoo in those.<P><center><i>Posted on Apr 7, 2002, 7:10 AM<BR> from IP address 65.229.116.34</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018188633'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>
<font face="Verdana"  ><center><b>Image Stabilizing Optics</b><br>by Ken Doe<P></center>Pinnacle tubes ARE filmed although I didn't know they used Indium Alloy GaAs for the photo cathode.<br>
I do agree they have wild photoresponse claims. The signal to noise ratio is more then double of any &quot;conventional&quot; image intensifier!  <br>
<br>
Although Image Stabilizing Optics *seem* to be magic and voodoo (the Canons *almost* are voodo) they're not breaking any laws of physics. There are 3 types that I know of:<br>
<br>
1. The Fujinon Stabiscope which mount the errecting prisms on a gimbled frame along with a high-speed gyroscope. When the gyro is spun-up, they provide ~5 degrees of stabilization. They have interchangable oculars and can be fitted with night vision eye-pieces. The 2nd generation version of these binos are waterproof and standard issue on the space shuttle! Fraser-Volpe also make a pair. Be careful you don't die from price sticker shock, they cost anywhere from $5k-$15k a pair depending on options! <br>
<br>
2. The Fujinon Techno-Stabi do not have interchangable night vision oculars and uses polycabonate to reduce weight. They employ accelerometers to measure the pitch &amp; yaw and by way of a microprocessor, provide a correction to direct drive motors which adjust the angle of the errecting prisms. Hence, no gyro. These binos also provide ~5 degrees of stabilization and can usually be bought for less then $1k<br>
<br>
3. Canon IS: These use what Canon calls a &quot;vari-angle prism&quot; which is in fact a lens consisting of two pieces of glass which sandwich some &quot;martini&quot; juice. A bellow around the outside edge of the glass allows it  to be squeezed which changes the defraction angle of the light as it passes through. There are a couple of interesting things about this. The technique was actually developed by a Hollywood cameraman in the 1950's who created some movie camera lens that worked using this principal decades before the stedi-cam became popular. I suspect that when the patents expired, Canon decided to use the technique. <br>
<br>
The Canon 10x30 IS binos are light weight and compact and can be had for ~$400. The image is amazingly flat and the 1 degree of stabilization is enough to remove hand tremors quite well. <br>
If you have a very good eye, you can sometimes see the image stabilzation working as the image appears to very slightly shimmer in and out of focus. You really have to be looking to notice it at all. You can also *hear* it &quot;buzz&quot; as its working if your in a very quite room. <br>
<br>
Once you've used image stabilized optics its very very hard to go back to using regular binos. I can't  stand to look through my 7x50 M-51 Fujinons' anymore  :-(  Image Stabilizing Optics are amazing to use. <P><center><i>Posted on Apr 7, 2002, 8:54 AM<BR> from IP address 64.228.73.37</i><P><a href='post?forumid=133782&messageid=1018194880'><b>Respond to this message</b></a><BR><BR><a href="133782"><b>Return to Index</b></a></center></font><P><HR>

The Celestron 11*80 is great for night sky viewing but is strictly a tripod operation. I once rested my elbows on the hood of an idling truck to get a view of incoming geese.

Charleston Hotel in Las Vegas, NV. Jennifer&lsquo;s unique style is instantly recognizable for her fearless use of vibrant color and the raw energy that her paintings exude.

I try to remain transparent in my work&rsquo; and that is what her collectors are so drawn to; they can relate to her paintings.<br><br>Jennifer Main also stays very active with donating artwork to her favorite charities such as March of Dimes, American Heart Association, Shade Tree, Race to Erase MS, and Project Sunshine.

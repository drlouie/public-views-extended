<b>Louis Cantillo is best known for his vibrant landscape photography and his collection of doors and windows of the world</b>

Louis has a gift for capturing unique perspectives on the familiar, through careful composition and use of color, texture, and contrast. 

Born in Caracas, Venezuela, Louis became interested in photography at an early age. He studied photography at Houston Community College from 1990-1992. An Arizona resident since 1992, Louis was drawn to the southwest by its rugged diversity and many challenges for the professional photographer. While Mr. Cantillo began his photographic career with Arizona landscapes, sunsets, and lightning shots, it was a chance side trip through the barrios of Tucson that led him to his real passion - that of photographing colorful doors and windows of the historic districts of the southwestern U.S. and Mexico.

Louis has received national recognition for his images of the El Presidio and Barrio Districts of Tucson. He has also expanded his portfolio to include doors of New Mexico, Colorado, California, and most recently Europe.

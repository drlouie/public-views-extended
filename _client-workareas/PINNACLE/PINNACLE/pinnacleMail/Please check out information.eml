To protect your Network Solutions domain name registration from unauthorized
or fraudulent transfers, we activate our free Domain Protect service for
each of your domain names automatically. This feature blocks domain name
transfers until you, or your designated contact, turns the feature "off".
This step allows you to control the "transferability" of your domain names,
and provides protection against "domain hijackers." Please note that if you
choose to turn Domain Protect "off" at any time, your domain name will be at
greater risk of being "slammed" (fraudulently transferred).

Domain Protect is quick and easy to manage through your Network Solutions
account.



1.	Log in to Account Manager at: http://www.networksolutions.com
<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=2257496610&fwdurl=http://www.n
etworksolutions.com> . If you've forgotten your log-in information, please

<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=2257496610&fwdurl=https://www.
networksolutions.com/manage-it/forget-login.jsp> .
2.	Click on the "Domains" tab in the left navigation menu to be taken
to a page listing your domain details.
3.	Select a domain name and click to turn "Domain Protect" on or off.

SET UP YOUR DOMAIN NAME

To get started you'll want to associate a domain name to your Web =
hosting
package.

If you registered a new domain name with Network Solutions when you =
ordered
your Web hosting package, you do not need to do anything else at this =
time.
We've automatically associated your new domain to your Web hosting =
package
for you.

If you did not register a domain name with us when you ordered your Web
hosting package, but have an existing domain name that you've registered
with Network Solutions or another company and want to use it for your =
Web
site, you will need to associate that domain name to your new Web =
hosting
package.

To associate an existing domain name to your Web hosting package:


1.	Log in to your account - follow the steps in the "Log In To Your
Account" section above - remember to click on the name of the Web =
hosting
package you wish to access (e.g., "Standard Hosting Package - Windows") =
from
the Web Hosting overview page.
2.	Click the "Assign Domain" button and follow the instructions for
associating a domain name to your Web hosting package.

BUILD YOUR WEB SITE

You can build your new Web site by either using ImageCaf=E9=AE Web Site =
Creator,
our template-based Web site design tool (no HTML experience required), =
or
external Web site development tool of your choice. If you have an =
existing
Web site and would like to transfer content from that site to your new =
Web
site, please refer to the "Upload/Add Content To Your Web Site <> " =
section
below.

Option 1: Build Your Web Site Using ImageCaf=E9=AE Web Site Creator
All Network Solutions Web hosting packages include ImageCaf=E9=AE Web =
Site
Creator, our premium Web site building tool. It's a template-based Web =
site
design tool that lets you quickly and easily create a professional and
customized Web site - and it doesn't require any HTML knowledge.

To start building your Web site using ImageCaf=E9=AE Web Site Creator:


1.	Log in to Account Manager at: http://www.networksolutions.com
<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=3D2257496620&fwdurl=3Dhttp:=

ebsiteuserguide.com> , then click on "Access ImageCaf=E9=AE Web Site =
Creator"
and follow our step-by-step wizard to select your design, color, theme, =

Option 2: Build Your Web Site Using Other Web Site Development Tools
You can also build your Web site using any external Web site development
tool of your choice, such as Dreamweaver=AE, Go Live=AE, etc.

If you choose to use another Web site development tool, prepare your Web
site using that program and then follow the instructions for uploading
content to your Web site listed below.

Upload/Add Content To Your Web Site
While building your Web site, you may want to upload/add content or =
files
(e.g., logos, images, text from an existing Web site, or customer
information) to your new Web site. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the
simplest and most common way to do this. To begin uploading/adding =
content
and files to your Web site, you will need to access an FTP server - we =
have
automatically enabled an FTP server for you.

To get started:


1.	Download software for an FTP Client of your choice. Some popular
options include:



*	WS_FTP (http://www.wsftp.com
<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=3D2257496620&fwdurl=3Dhttp:=
//www.w
sftp.com> )
*	Fetch (http://www.fetchftp.com

<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=3D2257496620&fwdurl=3Dhttp:=
//www.c

<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=3D2257496620&fwdurl=3Dhttp:=
//filez
illa.sourceforge.net> )

2.	To access the FTP server that we have automatically set up for you,
you will need to launch the FTP client that you downloaded in Step 1 =
above.
3.	Use your user name, password, and FTP host address (server IP
address) to begin uploading/adding your content to your new Web site.
4.	To obtain your FTP credentials:



*	Go to http://www.networksolutions.com
<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=3D2257496620&fwdurl=3Dhttp:=
//www.n
etworksolutions.com>  and log into Account Manager.
*	Click on your hosting account in Account Manager.
*	Click on the Hosting Control Panel button.
*	Click on the "Content Publishing" Menu Item in the left navigation.
*	Click on the "FTP Account Manager" Menu Item.

To protect your Network Solutions domain name registration from unauthorized
or fraudulent transfers, we activate our free Domain Protect service for
each of your domain names automatically. This feature blocks domain name
transfers until you, or your designated contact, turns the feature "off".
This step allows you to control the "transferability" of your domain names,
and provides protection against "domain hijackers." Please note that if you
choose to turn Domain Protect "off" at any time, your domain name will be at
greater risk of being "slammed" (fraudulently transferred).

Domain Protect is quick and easy to manage through your Network Solutions
account.



1.	Log in to Account Manager at: http://www.networksolutions.com
<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=2257772540&fwdurl=http://www.n

<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=2257772540&fwdurl=https://www.
networksolutions.com/manage-it/forget-login.jsp> .
2.	Click on the "Domains" tab in the left navigation menu to be taken
to a page listing your domain details.
3.	Select a domain name and click to turn "Domain Protect" on or off.

To protect your Network Solutions domain name registration from unauthorized
or fraudulent transfers, we activate our free Domain Protect service for
each of your domain names automatically. This feature blocks domain name
transfers until you, or your designated contact, turns the feature "off".
This step allows you to control the "transferability" of your domain names,
and provides protection against "domain hijackers." Please note that if you
choose to turn Domain Protect "off" at any time, your domain name will be at
greater risk of being "slammed" (fraudulently transferred).

Domain Protect is quick and easy to manage through your Network Solutions
account.



1.	Log in to Account Manager at: http://www.networksolutions.com
<http://cclinks.networksolutions.com/?emailid=2257773580&fwdurl=http://www.n

networksolutions.com/manage-it/forget-login.jsp> .
2.	Click on the "Domains" tab in the left navigation menu to be taken
to a page listing your domain details.
3.	Select a domain name and click to turn "Domain Protect" on or off.

		DynoForm is simply a flash form that is fed information by DynoForm.xml into the flash forms' internal lists of recipients and subjects.

		WARNINGS:
			- Always add new data to a CLEAN LINE, a NEW LINE
			- Dont add HTML or MARKUP data for this will break the flash scripting internally, for this is simply made to be a quick and simple form.
			- ALWAYS make a backup of this file before making changes, if you mess up you can always start all over again from the backup

		First: <requestType> will fill in the <artist> select list in the flash form
				- TO ADD ARTIST: You would add these lines following 4 lines right before the line containing </requestType>
			<artist>
